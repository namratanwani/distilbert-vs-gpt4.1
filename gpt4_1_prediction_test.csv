"chills,vomiting,fatigue,high_fever,headache,constipation,abdominal_pain,diarrhoea,toxic_look_(typhos),belly_pain","Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, headache, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, toxic look (typhos), and belly pain. The presence of high fever, abdominal symptoms, and a toxic look (typhos) are classic for typhoid fever.
Condition: typhoid"
"I've been having a headache, chest pain, and feeling unstable and off balance. I've also been feeling unwell and having problems focusing.","Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, feeling unstable/off balance, feeling unwell, and problems focusing. The combination of chest pain and neurological symptoms (instability, problems focusing) could suggest a serious cardiovascular or neurological event. Among the options, ""paralysis (brain hemorrhage)"" and ""heart attack"" are possibilities, but the presence of feeling off balance and problems focusing points more towards a neurological cause, such as a brain hemorrhage leading to paralysis or vertigo. However, ""paralysis (brain hemorrhage)"" is more likely to present with sudden neurological deficits, while ""(vertigo) paroymsal positional vertigo"" would primarily cause dizziness and imbalance without chest pain. Given the chest pain and headache, ""heart attack"" is the most likely among the options, as it can present with chest pain, headache, feeling unwell, and sometimes neurological symptoms due to poor perfusion.
Condition: heart attack"
"itching,fatigue,lethargy,yellowish_skin,dark_urine,loss_of_appetite,abdominal_pain,yellow_urine,yellowing_of_eyes,malaise,receiving_blood_transfusion,receiving_unsterile_injections","Reasoning: The symptoms include jaundice (yellowish skin, yellowing of eyes, yellow urine), fatigue, lethargy, malaise, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and risk factors such as receiving blood transfusions and unsterile injections.

Condition: hyperthyroidism"
"joint_pain,skin_peeling,silver_like_dusting,small_dents_in_nails,inflammatory_nails","Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, skin peeling, silver-like dusting, small dents in nails, and inflammatory nails. These are classic features of psoriasis, which often presents with silvery scales on the skin and nail changes such as pitting (small dents) and inflammation.
Condition: psoriasis"
"skin_rash,blister,red_sore_around_nose,yellow_crust_ooze","Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, blisters, red sores around the nose, and yellow crust oozing. These are classic signs of a superficial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which is characterized by red sores that can rupture, ooze, and form a yellow-brown crust, often around the nose and mouth.
Condition: impetigo"
"skin_rash,chills,joint_pain,vomiting,fatigue,high_fever,headache,nausea,loss_of_appetite,pain_behind_the_eyes,back_pain,malaise,muscle_pain,red_spots_over_body","Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, back pain, malaise, chills, and red spots over the body. This combination, especially the pain behind the eyes, high fever, rash, and muscle/joint pain, is characteristic of dengue.
Condition: dengue"
My skin sometimes peels off because of my rashes. I get sick more often because of it. My hands sometimes shake and I get shaky.,"Reasoning: The symptoms include skin peeling and rashes, increased susceptibility to illness, and hand tremors/shakiness. Skin rashes and peeling can be associated with allergies, drug reactions, or infections. Increased frequency of illness suggests a possible immune compromise, which can be seen in conditions like AIDS. Hand tremors and shakiness can be due to hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism, or neurological issues. However, the combination of skin issues, increased infections, and neurological symptoms (shakiness) most closely aligns with AIDS, as it is known to cause immune suppression leading to frequent infections and various skin manifestations.
Condition: aids"
"muscle_wasting,patches_in_throat,high_fever,extra_marital_contacts","Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle wasting, patches in the throat, high fever, and a history of extra-marital contacts.
