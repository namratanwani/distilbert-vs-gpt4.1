I have rashes on my skin that are itchy and I have a fever. I don't know what's causing it.,"Reasoning: The presence of itchy skin rashes and fever suggests an acute reaction, possibly due to an external agent. These symptoms are commonly seen in allergic reactions, drug reactions, or certain infections like chicken pox or dengue. However, chicken pox usually presents with vesicular (fluid-filled) lesions, and dengue often has other systemic symptoms like severe body pain. The combination of rash, itching, and fever is most characteristic of a drug reaction or allergy. Since the scenario does not mention exposure to a new medication, but does not rule it out either, both 'drug reaction' and 'allergy' are possible. However, 'allergy' is more commonly associated with itchy rashes and fever in the absence of drug exposure.

The symptoms of hypothyroidism depend on the severity of the condition. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over several years. At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain. Or you may think they are just part of getting older. But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems. Hypothyroidism symptoms may include:  Tiredness. More sensitivity to cold. Constipation. Dry skin. Weight gain. Puffy face. Hoarse voice. Coarse hair and skin. Muscle weakness. Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness. Menstrual cycles that are heavier than usual or irregular. Thinning hair. Slowed heart rate, also called bradycardia. Depression. Memory problems.  Hypothyroidism in infants Anyone can get hypothyroidism, including infants.

"headache,chest_pain,loss_of_balance,lack_of_concentration","Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms can be associated with a neurological event such as a brain hemorrhage, which can cause sudden headache, chest pain (possibly due to autonomic involvement or anxiety), loss of balance, and cognitive changes like lack of concentration. Among the given conditions, ""paralysis (brain hemorrhage)"" best fits this combination of symptoms.
Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)"
"I have been feeling very sick lately. I have been having severe itching, vomiting, and fatigue. I have also lost weight and have a high fever. My skin has turned yellow and my urine is dark. I am also experiencing abdominal pain.","Reasoning: The symptoms described include severe itching, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, high fever, jaundice (yellow skin), dark urine, and abdominal pain. These are classic signs of liver dysfunction, particularly jaundice and dark urine, which suggest a problem with bile excretion. The presence of fever and abdominal pain points towards an infectious or inflammatory process in the liver. Among the conditions listed, hepatitis (in its various forms) and chronic cholestasis are most likely. However, the combination of jaundice, dark urine, severe itching, and systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss is most consistent with chronic cholestasis.
Condition: chronic cholestasis"

Condition: malaria"
"I'm running a fever and I have a rash on my face, neck, and arms. The rash is painful and red. I'm worried about my health.","Reasoning: The symptoms described are fever and a painful, red rash on the face, neck, and arms. Among the conditions listed, ""impetigo"" and ""chicken pox"" can present with rash, but impetigo is typically not associated with fever and is more localized. ""Drug reaction"" and ""allergy"" can also cause rashes, but the presence of fever suggests an infectious cause. ""Dengue"" and ""malaria"" can cause fever and sometimes rash, but the rash in dengue is usually not described as painful and red. ""Chicken pox"" presents with fever and a painful, red rash that can appear on the face, neck, and arms, matching the symptoms described.
Condition: chicken pox"
"vomiting,breathlessness,sweating,chest_pain","Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, breathlessness, sweating, and chest pain are classic signs of a cardiac event, particularly a heart attack. These symptoms together are most commonly associated with myocardial infarction.
Condition: heart attack"
"I'm always tired, my mouth tastes bad, and my throat itches. My muscles are hot and painful, and my whole body can cramp up sometimes.","Reasoning: The symptoms include persistent tiredness (fatigue), bad taste in the mouth, itchy throat, muscle pain and heat, and occasional whole-body cramps. These symptoms are non-specific but suggest a systemic issue. Fatigue and muscle cramps can be seen in metabolic or endocrine disorders. Bad taste and itchy throat could suggest an infection or allergy, but the combination with muscle cramps and systemic fatigue is more suggestive of a metabolic disorder. Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue, muscle pain, cramps, and sometimes changes in taste or throat discomfort due to mucopolysaccharide deposition. 

Condition: hypothyroidism"
"back_pain,weakness_in_limbs,dizziness,loss_of_balance","Reasoning: The symptoms of back pain, weakness in limbs, dizziness, and loss of balance are commonly associated with nerve compression or issues related to the cervical spine.
