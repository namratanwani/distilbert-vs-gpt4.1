      "Reasoning: The symptoms include persistent tiredness (fatigue), bad taste in the mouth, itchy throat, muscle pain and heat, and occasional whole-body cramps. These symptoms are non-specific but suggest a systemic condition. Fatigue and muscle pain can be seen in many conditions, but the combination of bad taste in the mouth, itchy throat, and muscle symptoms could point towards a viral infection or a metabolic/endocrine disorder. However, the presence of muscle cramps and generalized symptoms is most consistent with \"hypothyroidism\" from the list, as hypothyroidism can cause fatigue, muscle pain, cramps, and sometimes changes in taste or throat discomfort due to goiter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hypothyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold hands and feet, mood swings, lethargy, dizziness, puffy face and eyes, enlarged thyroid, brittle nails, swollen extremities, depression, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an underactive thyroid gland, which is consistent with hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hypothyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are red, bumpy, itchy spots on the skin, with some bumps resembling little lumps and a change in skin color. These are classic signs of a skin allergy or a reaction, but among the options provided, \"allergy\" best fits the presentation of itchy, red, bumpy skin lesions.\n",
      "Condition: allergy\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, shivering, chills, and watering from eyes. These are classic symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, commonly known as the common cold.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include feeling sick and worn out (fatigue), high fever, weight loss, yellowing of skin and urine (jaundice), and stomach pain. These are classic signs of a liver-related condition, particularly hepatitis, which causes jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, cough, runny nose, congestion, throat irritation, sinus pressure, and loss of smell, which are classic symptoms of a respiratory infection. Additional symptoms like chills, fatigue, high fever, headache, malaise, swelled lymph nodes, phlegm, redness of eyes, chest pain, and muscle pain suggest a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Among the given conditions, 'common cold' best fits this cluster of symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of hepatitis, particularly the yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and abdominal pain, which are commonly seen in hepatitis infections.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chest pain, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. Chest pain is a key symptom that can indicate a cardiac issue, and when combined with dizziness and loss of balance, it raises concern for a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack. Lack of concentration can also occur due to reduced blood flow to the brain during such an event.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of jaundice, which is often associated with liver conditions. The yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice) along with abdominal pain and loss of appetite are particularly indicative of this. Among the options, \"jaundice\" directly matches these symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: jaundice\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include intense itching, rashy areas, changes in skin color, and painful lumps. These are classic signs of a skin reaction, which could be due to an allergy or a drug reaction. However, the presence of rash, itching, and painful lumps is more commonly associated with an allergic reaction, as drug reactions often have more systemic symptoms or specific patterns. The description does not mention any new medications, which makes allergy more likely.\n",
      "Condition: allergy\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, headache, nausea, spinning movements, loss of balance, and unsteadiness. These are classic signs of vertigo, particularly positional vertigo, which is characterized by spinning sensations and balance issues.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, sunken eyes, dehydration, and diarrhoea are classic signs of a gastrointestinal infection leading to fluid loss. These are hallmark features of gastroenteritis.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The sudden onset of headache, chest pain, dizziness, and difficulty maintaining balance could indicate a serious cardiovascular or neurological event. Among the conditions listed, \"heart attack\" is most consistent with sudden chest pain and dizziness during exertion. Another possibility could be \"(vertigo) paroymsal positional vertigo\" due to dizziness and balance issues, but the presence of chest pain makes \"heart attack\" more likely.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, and stomach bleeding. These are classic signs of severe hepatitis, particularly with acute liver failure and jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes). The presence of high fever and joint pain can be seen in viral hepatitis. Among the hepatitis types, hepatitis B, C, D, and E can cause acute liver failure, but hepatitis B is well-known for causing fulminant hepatitis with these severe symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle weakness, stiff neck, movement stiffness, and painful walking. These are commonly associated with joint and musculoskeletal disorders. Among the given conditions, cervical spondylosis is characterized by neck stiffness and can cause muscle weakness and movement stiffness. Osteoarthritis and arthritis can also cause joint stiffness and painful walking, but the presence of stiff neck specifically points more towards cervical spondylosis.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include weight gain, cold hands and feet, lethargy, puffy face and eyes, enlarged thyroid, brittle nails, swollen extremities, depression, irritability, abnormal menstruation, and mood swings. These are classic signs of an underactive thyroid gland, also known as hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hypothyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include weight gain, cold hands and feet, mood swings, lethargy, dizziness, puffy face and eyes, enlarged thyroid, brittle nails, swollen extremities, depression, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an underactive thyroid gland, which is characteristic of hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hypothyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, high fever, sweating, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and muscle pain. These are classic symptoms of a systemic infection with fever and chills, which are commonly seen in malaria. Malaria typically presents with high fever, chills, sweating, headache, muscle pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of jaundice, which is often associated with liver conditions. The yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice), along with abdominal pain and loss of appetite, are particularly indicative of hepatitis or other liver-related diseases. Among the options, these symptoms most closely match hepatitis, especially hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E. However, the most general and direct match for these symptoms is \"jaundice.\"\n",
      "Condition: jaundice\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle weakness, stiff neck, swelling joints, and painful walking. These are commonly associated with joint and musculoskeletal disorders. Swelling of joints and painful walking are classic signs of arthritis, and muscle weakness and stiff neck can also be present in this condition.\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, mood swings, weight loss, sweating, diarrhea, fast heart rate, excessive hunger, muscle weakness, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an overactive thyroid, which is known as hyperthyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hyperthyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include back pain, neck pain, weakness in arms and legs, dizziness, and trouble with balance. These symptoms are characteristic of cervical spondylosis, which can cause nerve compression leading to neurological symptoms such as weakness and balance issues.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, fast heart rate, and rusty sputum. These are classic signs of a lower respiratory tract infection, particularly pneumonia, which is known for producing rusty sputum and causing chest pain, fever, and breathlessness.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, stomach pain, burning micturition, and spotting on urination. Burning micturition and spotting on urination are classic signs of a urinary tract infection. The presence of skin symptoms could be due to irritation or a secondary effect, but the combination of urinary symptoms is most specific for a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include stiffness and weakness in the neck muscles, joint growth, and difficulty walking due to stiffness and discomfort. These symptoms are characteristic of cervical spondylosis, which commonly affects the neck and can cause stiffness, weakness, and discomfort in movement.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, joint pain, skin peeling, silver-like dusting, small dents in nails, and inflammatory nails. These are classic features of psoriasis, which often presents with silvery scales on the skin and nail changes such as pitting (small dents) and inflammation.\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, yellowish skin (jaundice), abdominal pain, swelling and distention of the abdomen, fluid overload, and a history of alcohol consumption. These are classic signs of liver dysfunction, particularly related to chronic alcohol use, leading to liver damage and subsequent symptoms such as ascites (fluid overload), jaundice, and abdominal swelling.\n",
      "Condition: alcoholic hepatitis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include small dents in the nails (nail pitting), joint pain, and a silver-like dusting on the skin, especially on the back. Nail pitting and silvery scales on the skin are classic signs of psoriasis, which can also be associated with joint pain (psoriatic arthritis).\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of headache, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration are commonly associated with vertigo, particularly paroxysmal positional vertigo, which is characterized by brief episodes of dizziness related to changes in head position and can also cause balance issues and concentration difficulties.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggests a form of hepatitis. Joint pain is particularly associated with hepatitis B, but can also be seen in hepatitis A and E. However, hepatitis A is more likely to present with acute onset and the listed symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, blisters, and yellow crust ooze. These are characteristic of a bacterial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which often presents with honey-colored (yellow) crusts over blisters and is associated with fever and rash.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chest pain, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. Chest pain is a key symptom that can indicate a cardiac issue, and when combined with dizziness and loss of balance, it raises concern for a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack. Lack of concentration can also occur due to reduced blood flow to the brain during such an event.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, blackheads, and scurring. Blackheads are a type of comedone commonly associated with acne. Skin rash and scurring (likely referring to scarring or crusting) can also be seen in acne.\n",
      "Condition: acne\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include weakness in limbs, neck pain, dizziness, and loss of balance. These are commonly associated with cervical spondylosis, which can cause nerve compression leading to neurological symptoms such as limb weakness and balance issues.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include constipation, pain during bowel movements, pain in the anal region, bloody stool, and irritation in the anus. These are classic symptoms of hemorrhoids (piles), particularly when there is pain and bleeding associated with defecation.\n",
      "Condition: dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are a rash on the face and near the nose, spreading to the arms and legs. Among the conditions listed, \"impetigo\" is a skin infection that commonly presents as a rash, often starting on the face and spreading to other parts of the body. Other conditions like \"allergy\" or \"fungal infection\" could cause rashes, but impetigo specifically matches the pattern of facial involvement and spreading.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include shivering and chills, which are commonly associated with infections that cause fever. Watering from eyes can occur in viral infections. Among the conditions listed, \"malaria\" is characterized by shivering and chills due to the cyclical fever, and sometimes patients may have watering from eyes due to associated fever or viral co-infection.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, and stomach bleeding. These are classic signs of severe hepatitis, particularly with acute liver failure and jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes). The presence of joint pain and high fever can be seen in viral hepatitis. Among the hepatitis types listed, hepatitis B, C, D, and E can cause acute liver failure, but hepatitis B is especially known for causing fulminant hepatitis with these severe symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle wasting, patches in the throat, high fever, and a history of extra-marital contacts. These are classic features of a chronic immunodeficiency state, particularly one that is sexually transmitted. The presence of muscle wasting and oral lesions (patches in throat) along with high fever and risk factors (extra-marital contacts) strongly suggest a diagnosis of AIDS.\n",
      "Condition: aids\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include jaundice (yellowish skin, yellowing of eyes, yellow urine), fatigue, malaise, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and risk factors such as receiving blood transfusions and unsterile injections. These are classic features of viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C, which is commonly transmitted through blood and can present with these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include acidity, indigestion, headache, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, stiff neck, depression, and visual disturbances. The combination of acidity and indigestion points towards a gastrointestinal issue, while headache, visual disturbances, and depression could be associated with a systemic or metabolic disorder. Excessive hunger is a classic symptom of diabetes, and diabetes can also cause visual disturbances and sometimes depression. The other symptoms can be secondary to metabolic imbalances seen in diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, phlegm, chest pain, fast heart rate, and rusty sputum.

      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggests a form of hepatitis. The presence of joint pain and mild fever is more characteristic of hepatitis B, C, or E. However, hepatitis B and C are less likely to present with acute symptoms like diarrhoea and mild fever, which are more typical of hepatitis A or E. Given the acute presentation and the list provided, hepatitis E is the most likely diagnosis.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis e\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, stomach pain, burning micturition, and spotting on urination. Burning micturition and spotting on urination are classic signs of a urinary tract infection. The presence of skin symptoms could be due to irritation or a secondary effect, but the combination of urinary symptoms is most specific for a urinary tract infection.\n",

Among the options, \"jaundice\" directly matches the symptom profile.\n",
      "Condition: jaundice\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include an itchy, red rash with weird-looking spots and some hard bumps on the skin. These are classic signs of a skin reaction, which could be due to an allergy or a drug reaction. However, the presence of \"weird looking spots\" and hard bumps leans more towards an allergic reaction or a drug reaction rather than a simple infection or other systemic illness. Since there is no mention of fever, systemic symptoms, or other organ involvement, and the primary complaint is a skin rash with itching, allergy is the most likely cause.\n",
      "Condition: allergy\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include stomach pain, acidity, vomiting, cough, and chest pain. The combination of stomach pain, acidity, and vomiting points towards a gastrointestinal issue, and chest pain can be associated with acid reflux or peptic ulcer complications.

      "Condition: alcoholic hepatitis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, and abdominal pain. The combination of yellowish skin and dark urine suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of high fever and abdominal pain further supports a liver infection. Among the hepatitis types, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis a, hepatitis d, or hepatitis e. However, the combination of weight loss and chronic symptoms is most characteristic of hepatitis c.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include a spreading, itchy rash with discolored spots and small bumps. These are classic signs of a skin-related condition, most commonly seen in allergic reactions or infections. However, the presence of discolored spots and bumps, along with intense itching and widespread distribution, is highly suggestive of a fungal infection, which often presents this way on the skin.\n",
      "Condition: fungal infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle weakness, swelling of joints, stiffness in movement, and painful walking. These are classic signs of joint inflammation and degeneration, which are commonly seen in arthritis-related conditions. Among the options, \"arthritis\" best fits this symptom cluster.\n",

These symptoms are not specific to allergies (which usually lack chills), nor do they fit other conditions in the list.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: Bloody stools and symptoms of anaemia (weakness, tiredness) are commonly associated with chronic blood loss, which can occur in conditions like hemorrhoids (piles). From the list, \"dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)\" is the most appropriate match for these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include back pain, weakness in limbs, neck pain, and dizziness. These are commonly associated with cervical spondylosis, which involves degeneration of the cervical spine and can cause nerve compression leading to these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, fatigue, anxiety, sweating, headache, nausea, excessive hunger, drying and tingling lips, slurred speech, irritability, and palpitations. These symptoms are characteristic of low blood sugar levels, which can cause neurological and autonomic symptoms such as slurred speech, irritability, palpitations, and excessive hunger.\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include neck and back pain, weakness, lightheadedness, and coughing up mucus. Neck and back pain with weakness and lightheadedness could suggest a neurological or musculoskeletal issue, but the presence of coughing up mucus points towards a respiratory condition. Among the options, pneumonia is characterized by cough with mucus, weakness, and sometimes body aches or pain. Cervical spondylosis would not typically cause cough with mucus. Therefore, pneumonia fits best.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include trouble breathing, persistent cough, production of thick mucus, fever, and exhaustion.

      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, indigestion, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, passage of gases, and internal itching. These symptoms are commonly associated with gastrointestinal issues. Among the given conditions, \"gastroenteritis\" typically presents with vomiting, abdominal pain, and indigestion. Internal itching could be related to irritation in the gastrointestinal tract. Other conditions like peptic ulcer disease or GERD do not usually present with internal itching. Therefore, gastroenteritis is the most fitting condition from the list.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include a persistent itchy rash, color changes in the skin, and bumps or lumps resembling knots. These are classic signs of a fungal infection, which often presents with persistent itching, discoloration, and raised lesions or nodules on the skin.\n",
      "Condition: fungal infection\n",

      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, neck pain, knee pain, hip joint pain, swelling of joints, and painful walking. These are characteristic of a degenerative joint disease affecting multiple joints, commonly seen in osteoarthritis.\n",
      "Condition: osteoarthristis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, joint pain, skin peeling, silver-like dusting, small dents in nails, and inflammatory nails. These are classic features of psoriasis, which often presents with silvery scales on the skin and nail changes such as pitting (small dents) and inflammation.\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms can be associated with a neurological event, particularly when loss of balance and lack of concentration are present alongside headache and chest pain. One possible cause is a brain hemorrhage leading to paralysis, which can present with these symptoms due to the effect on the brain and possible cardiovascular involvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, feeling unstable, balance issues, and trouble focusing. Among the listed conditions, '(vertigo) paroymsal positional vertigo' is characterized by balance issues, dizziness, and sometimes headache. Chest pain can occasionally be associated with vertigo due to anxiety or associated symptoms, but the key features here are balance and instability, which point towards vertigo.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, fast heart rate, and rusty sputum. These are classic signs of a lower respiratory tract infection, particularly pneumonia. Rusty sputum is especially characteristic of pneumonia, often due to Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of burning micturition, bladder discomfort, and foul smell of urine are classic signs of a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of constant hunger and appetite, stomach cramps and spasms, bloating, and gassiness after eating are suggestive of a gastrointestinal issue. Among the conditions listed, \"peptic ulcer disease\" and \"gastroesophageal reflux disease\" (GERD) can present with such symptoms, but peptic ulcer disease is more closely associated with increased hunger and abdominal discomfort that may be relieved or worsened by eating. GERD is more associated with heartburn and regurgitation. Therefore, peptic ulcer disease is the most fitting.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, blisters, red sores around the nose, and yellow crust oozing. These are characteristic of a bacterial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which commonly presents with red sores that rupture, ooze for a few days, and then form a yellowish-brown crust.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, high fever, headache, loss of appetite, mild fever, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, and red spots over the body. These are classic symptoms of chicken pox, which typically presents with a skin rash, fever, malaise, and red spots (vesicular rash) over the body.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include yellowish skin and yellowing of eyes (jaundice), nausea, loss of appetite, and a family history. These are classic signs of hepatitis, which causes jaundice due to liver dysfunction. Among the hepatitis options, the symptoms are general and could fit hepatitis a, b, c, d, or e, but without more specific information, the most general term is \"hepatitis a\" (as it is common and presents acutely with these symptoms).\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, high fever, yellowish skin, and dark urine. The combination of yellowish skin and dark urine suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of high fever and weight loss further points towards a serious liver infection. Among the hepatitis types, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis a, hepatitis d, or hepatitis e. However, hepatitis b is a common cause of chronic liver disease with these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, red spots over the body, high fever, headache, loss of appetite, malaise, and mild fever. These are classic symptoms of chicken pox, which typically presents with a skin rash, red spots, and systemic symptoms like fever and malaise.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, sunken eyes, dehydration, and diarrhoea are commonly seen in cases of acute gastroenteritis, which is an infection or irritation of the digestive tract leading to these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, blisters, red sores around the nose, and yellow crust oozing.

      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include jaundice (yellowish skin, yellowing of eyes, yellow urine), fatigue, malaise, abdominal pain, and risk factors such as receiving blood transfusions and unsterile injections. These are classic features of viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C, which is commonly transmitted through blood and can present with these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of continuous sneezing, shivering, and chills are commonly associated with viral upper respiratory tract infections. Among the given conditions, 'common cold' best matches these symptoms, as it typically presents with sneezing and sometimes mild chills or shivering.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include constipation, pain during bowel movements, pain in the anal region, bloody stool, and irritation in the anus. These are classic symptoms of hemorrhoids (piles), particularly when there is pain and bleeding associated with defecation.\n",
      "Condition: dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, sunken eyes, and diarrhoea suggest significant fluid loss and dehydration, which are commonly seen in gastroenteritis.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms can be associated with a neurological event such as a brain hemorrhage, which can cause sudden headache, chest pain (possibly due to autonomic involvement or anxiety), loss of balance, and cognitive changes like lack of concentration. Among the given conditions, \"paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\" best fits this combination of symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include severe itching, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, high fever, jaundice (yellow skin), dark urine, and abdominal pain. These are classic signs of liver dysfunction, particularly jaundice and dark urine, which suggest a problem with bile excretion. The presence of fever and abdominal pain points towards an infectious or inflammatory process in the liver. Among the conditions listed, hepatitis (in its various forms) and chronic cholestasis are most likely. However, the combination of jaundice, dark urine, severe itching, and systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss is most consistent with chronic cholestasis.\n",
      "Condition: chronic cholestasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, headache, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, toxic look (typhos), and belly pain. The presence of high fever, abdominal symptoms, and a toxic look (typhos) are classic for typhoid fever.\n",
      "Condition: typhoid\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include feeling sick, shaky, nauseous, sore throat with difficulty breathing, and occasional chest pains at night. The combination of sore throat and difficulty breathing could suggest a respiratory issue, but the presence of chest pain and shakiness could also point towards a metabolic or cardiac issue. However, the most likely condition from the list that matches these symptoms, especially with shakiness and feeling sick (which can be signs of low blood sugar), is hypoglycemia.\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms describedâ€”trouble concentrating, emotional instability, and mental fogâ€”are non-specific and could be seen in several conditions, but among the provided list, \"hypoglycemia\" (low blood sugar) is known to cause cognitive impairment, mood changes, and mental fogginess. Other conditions on the list do not primarily present with these neurological and cognitive symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, family history, and mucoid sputum. These are classic symptoms of a respiratory infection, particularly one that is chronic and can be associated with a family history. Tuberculosis often presents with these symptoms, especially the combination of cough, mucoid sputum, and high fever.\n",
      "Condition: tuberculosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a chronic or hereditary liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (various types) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The most likely condition from the list that matches these symptoms is hepatitis, and since the type is not specified but family history is present, hepatitis b is a strong candidate as it can be chronic and familial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",

      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, and abdominal pain. The combination of yellowish skin and dark urine suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of high fever and abdominal pain further supports a diagnosis of hepatitis. Among the hepatitis types listed, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis a, hepatitis d, or hepatitis e. However, the classic presentation with jaundice, dark urine, and systemic symptoms is most commonly associated with hepatitis b.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",

Malaria often presents with high fever, chills, sweating, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and diarrhoea.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are fever and a painful, red rash on the face, neck, and arms. Among the conditions listed, \"impetigo\" and \"chicken pox\" can present with rash, but impetigo is typically not associated with fever and is more localized. \"Drug reaction\" and \"allergy\" can also cause rashes, but the presence of fever suggests an infectious cause. \"Dengue\" and \"malaria\" can cause fever and sometimes rash, but the rash in dengue is usually not described as painful and red. \"Chicken pox\" presents with fever and a painful, red rash that can appear on the face, neck, and arms, matching the symptoms described.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, breathlessness, sweating, and chest pain are classic signs of a cardiac event, particularly a heart attack. These symptoms together are most commonly associated with myocardial infarction.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include persistent tiredness (fatigue), bad taste in the mouth, itchy throat, muscle pain and heat, and occasional whole-body cramps. These symptoms are non-specific but suggest a systemic issue. Fatigue and muscle cramps can be seen in metabolic or endocrine disorders. Bad taste and itchy throat could suggest an infection or allergy, but the combination with muscle cramps and systemic fatigue is more suggestive of a metabolic disorder. Hypothyroidism can cause fatigue, muscle pain, cramps, and sometimes changes in taste or throat discomfort due to mucopolysaccharide deposition. \n",
      "\n",

Malaria often presents with high fever, chills, sweating, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and diarrhoea.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The presence of rashes that peel and increase susceptibility to infections suggests a skin condition, possibly with immune involvement. The hand tremors and shaking could be neurological or metabolic. However, among the listed conditions, psoriasis is known for causing skin rashes that can peel and increase infection risk. Tremors are not classic for psoriasis, but none of the other conditions in the list combine these skin findings with tremors. Hyperthyroidism can cause tremors, but it does not typically cause peeling rashes. Therefore, the most fitting condition from the list is psoriasis.\n",

      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, breathlessness, sweating, and chest pain are classic signs of a cardiac event, particularly a heart attack. These symptoms together strongly suggest an acute coronary syndrome rather than other conditions on the list.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, headache, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, phlegm, throat irritation, redness of eyes, sinus pressure, runny nose, congestion, chest pain, loss of smell, and muscle pain. These are classic symptoms of a respiratory infection, particularly one that affects the upper respiratory tract. The presence of runny nose, congestion, loss of smell, and phlegm points towards a viral infection like the common cold.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are a rash that is red and burning, affecting the face, neck, and arms. This presentation is commonly seen in allergic reactions or drug reactions. However, the distribution and burning sensation are more typical of a drug reaction, especially if there is no mention of other allergy symptoms like itching, swelling, or respiratory involvement.\n",
      "Condition: drug reaction\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include burning micturition, bladder discomfort, foul smell of urine, and a continuous feeling of needing to urinate. These are classic signs of a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include trouble with balance, chest pains, headaches, pains all over the body, and trouble focusing. Trouble with balance suggests a neurological or vestibular issue. Chest pain could be cardiac or anxiety-related, but when combined with balance issues and headaches, a neurological cause is more likely. Among the given conditions, \"(vertigo) paroymsal positional vertigo\" is characterized by balance problems and sometimes headaches. Other conditions like heart attack focus more on chest pain and do not typically present with balance issues and headaches together. Therefore, the most fitting condition from the list is \"(vertigo) paroymsal positional vertigo\".\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, fatigue, anxiety, sweating, headache, nausea, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, drying and tingling lips, slurred speech, irritability, and palpitations. These symptoms are characteristic of low blood sugar levels, which can cause neurological and autonomic symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, irritability, slurred speech, and excessive hunger.\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, high fever, yellowish skin, and dark urine. Yellowish skin and dark urine are classic signs of jaundice, which is commonly associated with hepatitis. The presence of high fever, fatigue, and weight loss further supports a diagnosis of hepatitis. Among the hepatitis types listed, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis a, hepatitis d, or hepatitis e. However, the combination of chronic symptoms like weight loss and fatigue, along with jaundice, is most characteristic of hepatitis c.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cramps, bruising, obesity, swollen legs, and prominent veins on the calf. These are classic signs of venous insufficiency, particularly the presence of swollen legs and prominent veins, which are characteristic of varicose veins.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, joint pain, skin peeling, silver-like dusting, small dents in nails, and inflammatory nails. These are classic features of psoriasis, which often presents with silvery scales on the skin and nail changes such as pitting (small dents) and inflammation.\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are stomach ache, diarrhea, fever, and headache. These are classic symptoms of an infection affecting the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly gastroenteritis. Other conditions like typhoid or hepatitis can also cause some of these symptoms, but gastroenteritis is the most likely given the acute onset and combination of gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, pain behind the eyes, back pain, malaise, muscle pain, and red spots over the body. This combination, especially the presence of high fever, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and red spots over the body, is characteristic of dengue fever.\n",
      "Condition: dengue\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), nausea, loss of appetite, and a family history, which are classic signs of hepatitis. Among the hepatitis options, these symptoms are most commonly associated with hepatitis B, C, A, D, or E. However, the presence of family history is particularly relevant for hepatitis B, as it can be transmitted vertically or within families.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, headache, swelled lymph nodes, phlegm, throat irritation, redness of eyes, sinus pressure, runny nose, congestion, chest pain, loss of smell, and muscle pain. These are classic symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, commonly known as the common cold. The presence of sneezing, runny nose, congestion, and loss of smell are particularly indicative of this condition.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of hepatitis, particularly the yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and abdominal pain, which are associated with liver dysfunction. The presence of joint pain can be seen in some types of hepatitis as well. Among the hepatitis options, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis a, hepatitis d, or hepatitis e. However, the combination of joint pain and the other symptoms is most commonly associated with hepatitis b.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include joint pain, stiffness, swelling, and difficulty with movement, particularly affecting the knees and hands. These are classic signs of arthritis, which commonly presents with these symptoms and affects daily activities.\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include shivering and chills, which are commonly associated with infections that cause fever. Watering from eyes can be seen in viral infections. Among the conditions listed, \"malaria\" is characterized by shivering and chills due to the cyclical fever, and sometimes patients may have watering from eyes due to associated viral symptoms or high fever.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, dehydration, and diarrhoea are commonly seen in infections of the gastrointestinal tract, which lead to loss of fluids and electrolytes. These are classic features of gastroenteritis.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, sunken eyes, dehydration, and diarrhoea are classic signs of a gastrointestinal infection leading to fluid loss. These are hallmark features of gastroenteritis.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, shivering, chills, and watering from eyes. These are classic symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, commonly known as the common cold.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain. Yellowish skin suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The combination of gastrointestinal symptoms and jaundice points towards a form of hepatitis.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include fever, cough, shortness of breath, production of thick, sticky saliva (sputum), and fatigue. These are classic signs of a lower respiratory tract infection, most commonly pneumonia. Pneumonia often presents with these symptoms due to infection and inflammation of the lungs.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, high fever, headache, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, toxic look (typhos), and belly pain. The presence of high fever, abdominal symptoms, and a toxic look (typhos) are classic for typhoid fever.\n",
      "Condition: typhoid\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle wasting, patches in the throat, high fever, and a history of extra-marital contacts. These are classic features of a chronic immunodeficiency state, particularly one that is sexually transmitted. The presence of extra-marital contacts increases the risk of HIV infection, which can lead to AIDS. Muscle wasting and oral lesions (patches in throat) are common in advanced HIV/AIDS.\n",
      "Condition: aids\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include trouble concentrating, balance issues, headache, chest pain, and dizziness. These symptoms can be seen in several conditions, but the combination of balance issues, dizziness, and headache is most characteristic of (vertigo) paroymsal positional vertigo. Chest pain can sometimes be associated with dizziness due to vertigo, especially if anxiety or hyperventilation is present. Other conditions like heart attack could present with chest pain and dizziness, but the prominent balance issues and headache point more towards vertigo.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The yellowish skin and eyes suggest jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a chronic or hereditary liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E) and jaundice are possibilities, but the combination of symptoms most closely matches hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B or C, which can have a family history component. However, since \"jaundice\" is also a listed condition and is a direct description of the symptoms, but hepatitis B is more specific and fits the family history aspect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, headache, weakness of one body side, and altered sensorium. These are classic signs of a neurological event, particularly a stroke or brain hemorrhage, where there is sudden weakness on one side of the body and changes in consciousness.\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, chills, joint pain, vomiting, high fever, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, pain behind the eyes, back pain, malaise, muscle pain, and red spots over the body. This combination, especially the presence of high fever, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and red spots over the body, is characteristic of dengue fever.\n",
      "Condition: dengue\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, blisters, red sores around the nose, and yellow crust oozing. These are characteristic of a bacterial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which commonly presents with red sores that rupture, ooze, and form a yellowish-brown crust, often around the nose and mouth.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, joint pain, skin peeling, silver-like dusting, small dents in nails, and inflammatory nails. These are classic features of psoriasis, which often presents with silvery scales on the skin and nail changes such as pitting (small dents) and inflammation.\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms can be associated with several conditions, but the combination of chest pain, dizziness, and loss of balance is particularly concerning for a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack. Headache and lack of concentration can also occur during a heart attack due to reduced blood flow to the brain.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The main symptoms are breathing problems (especially outside), sudden flushing and perspiring, and frequent yeast and urinary tract infections. Breathing problems triggered by being outside suggest an allergic or respiratory component, possibly 'bronchial asthma' or 'allergy'. However, frequent yeast and urinary tract infections are more commonly associated with immune compromise or diabetes. Diabetes can also cause increased susceptibility to infections and sometimes autonomic symptoms like flushing and sweating. The combination of these symptoms most closely matches 'diabetes'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cough, breathlessness, family history, and mucoid sputum. These are classic symptoms of a chronic respiratory condition. The presence of mucoid sputum and breathlessness, along with a family history, points towards a chronic airway disease. Among the options, 'bronchial asthma' fits best, as it is characterized by these symptoms and often has a family history component.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: bronchial asthma\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, headache, weakness of one body side, and altered sensorium. These are classic signs of a neurological event, particularly a stroke or brain hemorrhage, where there is sudden weakness on one side of the body and changes in consciousness.\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, headache, and altered sensorium are commonly seen in malaria, especially in severe cases where cerebral involvement (cerebral malaria) can occur. These symptoms are less typical for other conditions in the list.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include itching, rashy patches, changes in skin color, and painful lumps. These are commonly associated with skin conditions. Among the options, \"fungal infection\" often presents with itching, rash, discoloration, and sometimes painful lumps if there is secondary infection or inflammation. Other conditions like \"allergy\" can cause itching and rash, but discoloration and painful lumps are less typical. \"Impetigo\" and \"psoriasis\" could also cause skin changes, but impetigo is more about blisters and oozing, and psoriasis is more about silvery scales. \"Fungal infection\" best fits the described symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: fungal infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, loss of appetite, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, and blood in sputum. The combination of cough, blood in sputum, chest pain, fever, night sweats, and weight loss (loss of appetite, malaise) is highly suggestive of tuberculosis. Yellowing of eyes can sometimes be seen in advanced cases due to liver involvement or co-infection, but the overall symptom complex fits tuberculosis best.\n",
      "Condition: tuberculosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms are commonly associated with cardiovascular or neurological issues. Among the given conditions, 'heart attack' can present with chest pain, headache, dizziness, and sometimes loss of balance and concentration due to reduced blood flow to the brain.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of jaundice, which can be caused by various types of hepatitis.

Among the options, hepatitis a, hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis d, and hepatitis e are all possible, but the symptoms are most commonly associated with hepatitis a.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, weakness of one body side, and altered sensorium. These are classic signs of a neurological event, particularly a stroke or brain hemorrhage, where one side of the body becomes weak and consciousness or mental status is altered.\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, lethargy, irregular sugar level, blurred and distorted vision, obesity, excessive hunger, increased appetite, and polyuria. These are classic symptoms of diabetes, which is characterized by high blood sugar levels, increased hunger and thirst, frequent urination, and sometimes weight loss and vision problems.\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, stomach pain, burning micturition, and spotting on urination. Burning micturition and spotting on urination are classic signs of a urinary tract infection, while itching and skin rash can sometimes be associated with infections or allergic reactions. However, the combination of urinary symptoms with stomach pain points most strongly to a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle weakness, stiff neck, swelling of joints, movement stiffness, and painful walking. These are characteristic of joint-related disorders, particularly those involving inflammation and degeneration of the joints. The presence of swelling, stiffness, and pain in movement points towards arthritis, which is a common cause of such symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggests a form of hepatitis. Joint pain is particularly associated with hepatitis B, but can also be seen in hepatitis A and E. However, hepatitis A is more likely to present with acute symptoms including fever, jaundice, and gastrointestinal upset.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include alternating constipation and diarrhea, fatigue, loss of appetite, and exhaustion. These symptoms are commonly associated with chronic liver conditions, particularly those that affect bile flow and liver function, such as chronic cholestasis. Chronic cholestasis can cause changes in bowel habits, fatigue, and loss of appetite due to impaired digestion and absorption of nutrients.\n",
      "Condition: chronic cholestasis\n",
      "Reasoning: Loss of libido, difficulty with arousal, brain fog, and confusion can be associated with hormonal imbalances. Among the conditions listed, hypothyroidism is known to cause decreased libido, cognitive slowing (brain fog), and confusion.\n",
      "Condition: hypothyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include belching and burping (which can be related to gastrointestinal issues), but more importantly, chest pain radiating to the arm, jaw, and back of the neck, along with a feeling of pressure and stress in the chest, are classic signs of a heart attack.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle weakness, stiff neck, swelling of joints, movement stiffness, and painful walking. These are characteristic of joint and musculoskeletal disorders, particularly those involving inflammation and degeneration of the joints. The presence of swelling joints and movement stiffness points towards arthritis-related conditions. Among the options, \"arthritis\" best fits this symptom cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include recurrent headaches, typically on one side of the head, severe pain, nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. These are classic features of migraine headaches.\n",
      "Condition: migraine\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold hands and feet, mood swings, lethargy, dizziness, puffy face and eyes, enlarged thyroid, brittle nails, swollen extremities, depression, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an underactive thyroid gland, which is characteristic of hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hypothyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include stomach pain, ulcers on the tongue, vomiting, cough, and chest pain. The combination of stomach pain and ulcers on the tongue, along with vomiting, points towards a gastrointestinal issue. Chest pain and cough could be associated with acid reflux affecting the esophagus. Among the given conditions, \"peptic ulcer disease\" is most consistent with these symptoms, as it can cause stomach pain, vomiting, and sometimes ulcers in the mouth due to acid exposure. Chest pain and cough can also occur if acid reflux is present.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, yellowish skin, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of jaundice, which can be caused by various types of hepatitis. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), abdominal pain, and loss of appetite is particularly suggestive of hepatitis.

The presence of high fever, abdominal pain, constipation, and a toxic look (typhos) are classic features of typhoid fever.\n",
      "Condition: typhoid\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include back pain radiating down the arms and legs, neck pain, trouble with balance, and dizziness. These are classic signs of nerve compression or irritation in the cervical spine, which is characteristic of cervical spondylosis.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, joint pain, skin peeling, silver-like dusting, small dents in nails, and inflammatory nails. These are classic features of psoriasis, which often presents with silvery scales on the skin and nail changes such as pitting (small dents) and inflammation.\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include jaundice (yellowish skin, yellowing of eyes, yellow urine), fatigue, malaise, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and risk factors such as receiving blood transfusions and unsterile injections. These are classic features of viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C, which is commonly transmitted through blood and can present with these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, and stomach bleeding. These are classic signs of severe hepatitis, particularly with acute liver failure and jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes). Among the hepatitis types listed, hepatitis B, C, D, and E can cause acute liver failure, but hepatitis B is well-known for causing fulminant hepatitis with these severe symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cough, high fever, family history, and mucoid sputum. These are classic symptoms of a respiratory infection, particularly tuberculosis, which often presents with cough, fever, fatigue, and sputum production, and can have a family history component due to close contact transmission.\n",

      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle weakness, stiff neck, movement stiffness, and painful walking. These are commonly associated with joint and musculoskeletal disorders. Among the given conditions, cervical spondylosis is characterized by neck stiffness and pain, and can also cause muscle weakness and movement difficulties. Osteoarthritis and arthritis can also cause joint stiffness and painful movement, but the presence of a stiff neck specifically points more towards cervical spondylosis.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The yellowish skin and eyes suggest jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (various types) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The combination of these symptoms most closely matches hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B, C, D, or E. Since family history is mentioned, hepatitis B is often associated with chronic infection and can be familial.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, neck pain, hip joint pain, swelling of joints, and painful walking. These are characteristic of a condition affecting multiple joints, often with swelling and pain, which is typical of arthritis.\n",

      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and abdominal pain suggests a liver-related condition. The presence of joint pain and mild fever further supports a viral hepatitis. Among the hepatitis types, hepatitis A commonly presents with these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, pus-filled pimples, blackheads, and scurring. These are classic signs of a skin condition characterized by pimples and comedones, which is commonly known as acne.\n",
      "Condition: acne\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, headache, nausea, spinning movements, loss of balance, and unsteadiness. These are classic signs of vertigo, particularly positional vertigo, which is characterized by spinning sensations and balance issues.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, headache, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, toxic look (typhos), and belly pain. The presence of high fever, abdominal symptoms, and a toxic look (typhos) are classic for typhoid fever.\n",
      "Condition: typhoid\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include high fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, skin rash, red spots over body, chills, malaise, and loss of appetite. This combination, especially the pain behind the eyes, high fever, muscle and joint pain, and red spots/rash, is characteristic of dengue fever.\n",
      "Condition: dengue\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, passage of gases, and internal itching. These symptoms are commonly associated with liver-related conditions, particularly those involving cholestasis (reduced or stopped bile flow), which can cause internal itching (pruritus), abdominal pain, and digestive symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: chronic cholestasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include acidity, indigestion, headache, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, stiff neck, depression, irritability, and visual disturbances. The combination of headache, visual disturbances, and irritability is commonly seen in migraine. Other conditions in the list do not typically present with this specific cluster of symptoms, especially the visual disturbances and headache together.\n",
      "Condition: migraine\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, yellowish skin (jaundice), abdominal pain, swelling and distention of the abdomen, fluid overload, and a history of alcohol consumption. These are classic signs of liver dysfunction, particularly related to chronic alcohol use, leading to alcoholic hepatitis.\n",
      "Condition: alcoholic hepatitis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, cough, runny nose, congestion, throat irritation, sinus pressure, and loss of smell, which are classic symptoms of a respiratory infection. Additional symptoms like chills, fatigue, high fever, malaise, swelled lymph nodes, phlegm, redness of eyes, chest pain, and muscle pain suggest a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Among the given conditions, 'common cold' best matches this cluster of symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The combination of yellowish skin and yellowing of eyes suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions such as hepatitis. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver condition. Among the options, hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The symptoms best fit hepatitis, but since the specific type is not mentioned, the most general and likely is hepatitis b or hepatitis c. Given the family history, hepatitis b is more likely due to its potential for vertical transmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, joint pain, silver-like dusting, small dents in nails, and inflammatory nails. These are classic features of psoriasis, particularly the silver-like scaling and nail changes (pitting and inflammation).\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, indigestion, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, passage of gases, and internal itching. These symptoms are commonly associated with gastrointestinal issues. Among the given conditions, \"gastroenteritis\" typically presents with vomiting, abdominal pain, and indigestion. Internal itching could be related to irritation in the gastrointestinal tract. Other conditions like peptic ulcer disease or GERD do not usually present with internal itching. Therefore, gastroenteritis is the most fitting condition.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggests a form of hepatitis. The presence of joint pain and mild fever is more characteristic of hepatitis B, C, or E. However, hepatitis B and C are less likely to present acutely with these symptoms, while hepatitis E often presents with these symptoms, especially in adults. Hepatitis A can also present similarly, but joint pain is more commonly associated with hepatitis E.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis e\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, fast heart rate, and rusty sputum. These are classic signs of a lower respiratory tract infection, particularly pneumonia, which is known for producing rusty sputum and causing chest pain, fever, and breathlessness.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, fatigue, anxiety, headache, nausea, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, drying and tingling lips, slurred speech, irritability, and palpitations. These symptoms are characteristic of low blood sugar levels, which can cause neurological and autonomic symptoms such as slurred speech, irritability, palpitations, and excessive hunger. This matches the clinical presentation of hypoglycemia.\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include jaundice (yellowish skin, yellowing of eyes, yellow urine), fatigue, malaise, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and risk factors such as receiving blood transfusions and unsterile injections. These are classic features of viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C, which is commonly transmitted through blood and unsterile injections.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include back pain, neck pain, weakness in arms and legs, dizziness, and feeling off-balance. These are classic signs of cervical spondylosis, which affects the cervical spine and can cause neurological symptoms due to nerve compression.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: Pain in lymph nodes and widespread rashes are commonly associated with allergic reactions or drug reactions. However, the presence of severe rashes and lymph node pain, especially if sleep is disturbed due to itching or discomfort, is more characteristic of a drug reaction, which often presents with systemic symptoms and can be severe.\n",
      "Condition: drug reaction\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, stomach pain, burning micturition, and spotting on urination. Burning micturition and spotting on urination are classic signs of a urinary tract infection. The presence of skin symptoms could be due to irritation or a secondary reaction, but the combination of urinary symptoms is most specific for a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, and stomach bleeding. The presence of yellowish skin and eyes, acute liver failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggest a severe liver condition. Among the options, hepatitis (specifically hepatitis B, C, D, or E) can present with these symptoms, but acute liver failure and coma are most commonly associated with hepatitis B.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, restlessness, lethargy, irregular sugar level, blurred and distorted vision, obesity, excessive hunger, increased appetite, and polyuria. These are classic symptoms of diabetes, particularly the irregular sugar level, polyuria (frequent urination), excessive hunger, and blurred vision.\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include back pain, weakness in limbs, neck pain, dizziness, and loss of balance. These are commonly associated with nerve compression or issues in the cervical spine, which can lead to neurological symptoms such as weakness and balance problems.\n",

      "Condition: dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, blisters, red sores around the nose, and yellow crust oozing. These are classic signs of a superficial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which is characterized by red sores that can rupture, ooze, and form a yellowish-brown crust, often around the nose and mouth.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, fatigue, anxiety, sweating, nausea, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, drying and tingling lips, slurred speech, irritability, and palpitations. These symptoms are characteristic of low blood sugar levels, which can cause neurological and autonomic symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, irritability, slurred speech, and excessive hunger. This matches the clinical presentation of hypoglycemia.\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include a red, itchy, painful rash with blistering on the face, along with flu-like symptoms such as fever and body pain. These features are characteristic of chicken pox, which typically presents with a blistering rash and systemic symptoms like fever and malaise.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle wasting, patches in the throat, high fever, and a history of extra-marital contacts. These are classic signs of a chronic immunodeficiency, particularly one that is sexually transmitted. The presence of muscle wasting and oral lesions (patches in throat) along with high fever and risk factors (extra-marital contacts) strongly suggest HIV/AIDS.\n",
      "Condition: aids\n",
      "Reasoning: Muscle wasting, patches in the throat, and high fever are indicative of a chronic immunocompromised state with opportunistic infections, which is characteristic of AIDS.\n",
      "Condition: aids\n",
      "Reasoning: Chest pain, dizziness, and a headache with constant pressure in the forehead can be symptoms of several conditions, but the combination of chest pain and dizziness is particularly concerning for a cardiovascular issue. While headache and dizziness can be seen in migraine or hypertension, the presence of chest pain makes \"heart attack\" the most likely condition from the list.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, fatigue, anxiety, sweating, headache, nausea, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, slurred speech, irritability, and palpitations. These symptoms are characteristic of low blood sugar levels, which can cause neurological and autonomic symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, irritability, and slurred speech. Excessive hunger and blurred vision are also common in this condition.\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The sudden onset of headache, chest pain, and dizziness, especially while driving, raises concern for a serious acute event. The combination of chest pain and dizziness could indicate a cardiovascular issue, such as a heart attack, which can also cause difficulty concentrating due to reduced blood flow. Other conditions like migraine or hypoglycemia could cause some of these symptoms, but chest pain is most concerning for a cardiac event.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, high fever, sweating, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and muscle pain. These are classic symptoms of a febrile illness with systemic involvement. The combination of high fever, chills, and sweating is particularly characteristic of malaria, which often presents with these symptoms along with gastrointestinal complaints and muscle pain.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include swollen legs, swollen blood vessels, prominent veins on the calf, cramps, and fatigue.

      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin peeling, rashes on multiple areas (arms, legs, back), and joint pain. These are commonly associated with psoriasis, which is a chronic autoimmune skin condition that often presents with rashes, scaling, and sometimes joint involvement (psoriatic arthritis).\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include trouble breathing, feeling like drowning, coughing up a lot of phlegm, chest pain, sweating, and a racing heart. These symptoms are most consistent with a respiratory infection, particularly one that causes significant lung involvement and production of phlegm. Among the conditions listed, pneumonia best matches these symptoms, as it often presents with cough, phlegm, chest pain, difficulty breathing, and systemic symptoms like sweating and tachycardia.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle weakness, stiff neck, swelling of joints, movement stiffness, and painful walking. These are characteristic of joint-related disorders, particularly those involving inflammation and degeneration of the joints. The presence of swelling, stiffness, and pain with movement points towards arthritis, which commonly presents with these symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include constipation, pain during bowel movements, pain in the anal region, bloody stool, and irritation in the anus. These are classic symptoms of hemorrhoids (piles), particularly when there is pain and bleeding associated with defecation.\n",
      "Condition: dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, blisters, red sores around the nose, and yellow crust oozing. These are characteristic of a bacterial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which often presents with red sores and yellowish crusts, especially around the nose and mouth.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, mood swings, weight loss, restlessness, sweating, diarrhea, fast heart rate, excessive hunger, muscle weakness, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an overactive thyroid, which is known as hyperthyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hyperthyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include stomach pain, acidity, ulcers on the tongue, vomiting, cough, and chest pain. The combination of stomach pain, acidity, vomiting, and ulcers on the tongue points towards a gastrointestinal issue, particularly one involving acid. Chest pain and cough could be related to acid reflux irritating the esophagus and respiratory tract. The most fitting condition from the list that matches these symptoms is peptic ulcer disease.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include swollen legs, swollen blood vessels, prominent veins on the calf, cramps, and fatigue. These are classic signs of venous insufficiency, particularly varicose veins, which are characterized by prominent, swollen veins, especially in the legs, and can be associated with cramps, fatigue, and sometimes bruising and obesity as risk factors.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, and abdominal pain. The combination of yellowish skin and dark urine suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of high fever and abdominal pain further supports a liver infection. Among the hepatitis types listed, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis a, hepatitis d, or hepatitis e. However, the combination of chronic symptoms like weight loss and fatigue, along with jaundice and dark urine, is most characteristic of hepatitis c.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",

      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, high fever, breathlessness, family history, and mucoid sputum. These symptoms are commonly associated with respiratory infections, particularly pneumonia, which often presents with fever, breathlessness, and sputum production.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, blackheads, and scurring. Blackheads are a type of comedone commonly associated with acne. Skin rash and scurring (likely referring to scarring or crusting) can also be seen in acne.\n",
      "Condition: acne\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, yellowish skin (jaundice), abdominal pain, swelling and distention of the abdomen, fluid overload, and a history of alcohol consumption. These are classic signs of liver dysfunction, particularly related to chronic alcohol use, leading to liver damage and fluid accumulation (ascites).\n",
      "Condition: alcoholic hepatitis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are joint pain, difficulty moving, fatigue, and weakness. These are classic symptoms of arthritis, which is characterized by joint pain and stiffness, often accompanied by fatigue.\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, high fever, sweating, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and muscle pain.

      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include stomach pain, acidity, vomiting, cough, and chest pain. The combination of stomach pain, acidity, vomiting, and chest pain points towards a gastrointestinal issue, particularly one involving acid reflux or ulceration. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and peptic ulcer disease are both possibilities, but the presence of acidity and chest pain is more characteristic of GERD, which can also cause cough due to acid irritating the esophagus and airways.\n",
      "Condition: gerd\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of breathlessness, sweating, and chest pain are classic signs of a cardiac event, most notably a heart attack. These symptoms are not typical of respiratory infections, allergies, or other conditions in the list, but are hallmark features of myocardial infarction.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include high fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, skin rash, red spots over body, and malaise.

      "Condition: hyperthyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The combination of neck pain, vertigo, instability, chronic cough, and limb weakness suggests a neurological or cervical spine issue. Cervical spondylosis can cause neck pain, vertigo (due to vertebral artery involvement), instability, and limb weakness due to nerve compression. Chronic cough can sometimes be associated with cervical spondylosis due to phrenic nerve irritation or referred symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (various types) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The most likely condition from the list that matches these symptoms is hepatitis, and since the specific type is not mentioned but family history is present, hepatitis b is a common hereditary form.\n",

      "Condition: tuberculosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, breathlessness, sweating, and chest pain are classic signs of a cardiac event, particularly a heart attack. These symptoms together are not typical for respiratory, gastrointestinal, or infectious diseases, but are highly suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, indigestion, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, passage of gases, and internal itching. These symptoms are commonly associated with gastrointestinal issues. Among the given conditions, \"gastroenteritis\" typically presents with vomiting, abdominal pain, and indigestion. Internal itching could be related to irritation in the gastrointestinal tract. Other conditions like peptic ulcer disease or GERD do not usually present with internal itching. Therefore, gastroenteritis is the most fitting condition from the list.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, fast heart rate, and rusty sputum.

      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include a rash with dischromic patches, nodular eruptions, and severe itching. These are classic signs of a fungal infection, which often presents with discolored patches, nodules, and intense pruritus (itching). The progression over a week also fits the typical course of a fungal skin infection.\n",
      "Condition: fungal infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, fatigue, lethargy, high fever, headache, loss of appetite, mild fever, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, and red spots over the body. The combination of high fever, malaise, and red spots over the body is characteristic of viral infections like chicken pox or dengue. However, the presence of itching and red spots over the body, along with mild fever and swelled lymph nodes, is more typical of chicken pox.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, blisters, red sores around the nose, and yellow crust oozing. These are characteristic of a bacterial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which often presents with red sores that rupture, ooze for a few days, and then form a yellowish-brown crust.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggests a form of hepatitis.

However, hepatitis B and C are less likely to present acutely with diarrhoea and fever, while hepatitis E often presents with these symptoms, especially in areas where it is endemic.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis e\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, neck pain, knee pain, hip joint pain, swelling of joints, and painful walking. These are characteristic of a chronic joint disorder affecting multiple joints, often associated with inflammation and pain. Among the options, \"arthritis\" best fits this symptom cluster, as it commonly presents with joint pain, swelling, and difficulty in movement.\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, dizziness, and lack of concentration. These symptoms can be seen in several conditions, but the combination of chest pain and dizziness is particularly concerning for a cardiovascular issue. Headache and lack of concentration can also be associated with reduced blood flow or oxygen to the brain, which can occur during a heart attack. Other conditions like hypertension or hypoglycemia could present similarly, but chest pain is most characteristic of a heart attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include pain in the lower abdomen, pain or discomfort during urination, weakness, and low body temperature. These are classic signs of a urinary tract infection, which often presents with lower abdominal pain and dysuria (painful urination). Weakness can be associated with infection, and while fever is more common, some people may experience low body temperature, especially if the infection is severe or in certain populations.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include a widespread, itchy, red, and bumpy rash with some darkened spots and nodular breakouts. These features are commonly associated with allergic reactions or drug reactions, but the presence of nodular breakouts and the chronicity suggest a possible fungal infection or psoriasis. However, the intense itchiness, red bumpy rash, and progression over days are most consistent with a fungal infection, which often presents with these symptoms and can worsen over time if untreated.\n",
      "Condition: fungal infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, loss of appetite, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, and blood in sputum.

It is characterized by red sores or rash, commonly in children but can occur in adults as well.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The combination of yellowish skin and yellowing of eyes suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (various types) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The most likely condition from the list that matches these symptoms is hepatitis, and since the type is not specified but family history is present, hepatitis b is a likely candidate as it can be transmitted vertically and has a chronic course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, high fever, breathlessness, family history, and mucoid sputum. These symptoms are commonly associated with respiratory infections.

      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The yellowish skin and eyes suggest jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (various types) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The combination of symptoms fits best with hepatitis, and since the type is not specified but family history is present, hepatitis b is a likely candidate as it can be chronic and familial.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms can be associated with a neurological event such as a brain hemorrhage, which can cause sudden headache, chest pain (possibly due to autonomic involvement or anxiety), loss of balance, and cognitive changes like lack of concentration. Among the given conditions, \"paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\" best fits this combination of symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms can be seen in several conditions, but the combination of chest pain, dizziness, and loss of balance is particularly concerning for a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack. Headache and lack of concentration can also occur due to reduced blood flow to the brain during such an event.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include swollen legs, swollen blood vessels, prominent veins on the calf, and obesity. These are classic signs of venous insufficiency, particularly varicose veins. Fatigue and cramps can also be associated with poor venous return in the legs, and bruising may occur due to fragile veins.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of jaundice, which is often associated with liver conditions. The yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice), along with abdominal pain and loss of appetite, are particularly indicative of hepatitis. Among the hepatitis types listed, these symptoms are common to all, but without more specific information, the general presentation fits hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E. However, hepatitis A is most commonly associated with acute onset and these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, indigestion, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, passage of gases, and internal itching. These symptoms are commonly associated with gastrointestinal issues. Among the given conditions, \"gastroenteritis\" typically presents with vomiting, abdominal pain, and indigestion. Internal itching could be related to irritation in the gastrointestinal tract. Other conditions like peptic ulcer disease or GERD do not usually present with internal itching. Therefore, gastroenteritis is the most fitting condition from the list.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, high fever, breathlessness, family history, and mucoid sputum. These symptoms are commonly associated with respiratory infections. The presence of mucoid sputum and breathlessness points towards a lung infection, and high fever supports an infectious etiology. Among the given conditions, pneumonia best fits this combination of symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, fatigue, anxiety, sweating, headache, nausea, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, drying and tingling lips, slurred speech, irritability, and palpitations. These symptoms are characteristic of low blood sugar levels, which can cause neurological and autonomic symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, irritability, slurred speech, and excessive hunger.\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, headache, weakness of one body side, and altered sensorium. These are classic signs of a neurological event, particularly a stroke or brain hemorrhage, where there is sudden weakness on one side of the body and changes in consciousness.\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, neck pain, hip joint pain, swelling of joints, and painful walking. These are characteristic of a condition affecting multiple joints, often with swelling and pain, which is typical of arthritis.\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, indigestion, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and internal itching. These are commonly associated with liver-related conditions, particularly hepatitis. Internal itching is a classic symptom of cholestasis, which is impaired bile flow often seen in chronic liver diseases. The combination of gastrointestinal symptoms and internal itching points towards a liver condition rather than a gastrointestinal infection or other causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: chronic cholestasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include muscular weakness and stiffness in the neck, swollen joints, and painful movement, especially while walking. These are classic signs of a joint-related disorder, particularly one that affects mobility and causes joint swelling and stiffness. Among the conditions listed, \"arthritis\" best matches these symptoms, as it commonly presents with joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, and can affect mobility.\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of breathlessness, sweating, and chest pain are classic signs of a cardiac event, particularly a heart attack. These symptoms are not typical of respiratory infections, allergies, or other listed conditions.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include jaundice (yellowish skin, yellowing of eyes, yellow urine), fatigue, lethargy, malaise, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and risk factors such as receiving blood transfusions and unsterile injections. These are classic features of viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C, which is commonly transmitted through blood and can present with these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include vomiting, high fever, jaundice (yellow skin), dark urine, and abdominal pain. These are classic signs of hepatitis, which is an inflammation of the liver. The presence of jaundice and dark urine particularly point towards a hepatic cause. Among the hepatitis options in the list (hepatitis a, hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis d, hepatitis e, alcoholic hepatitis), the symptoms fit with any acute hepatitis, but the scenario does not specify a history of alcohol use, so alcoholic hepatitis is less likely. The most common acute viral hepatitis presenting with these symptoms is hepatitis a.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, fast heart rate, and rusty sputum. These are classic signs of a lower respiratory tract infection, particularly pneumonia, which is known for producing rusty sputum and causing chest pain, fever, and respiratory symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle weakness, stiff neck, swelling of joints, movement stiffness, and painful walking. These are characteristic of joint and musculoskeletal disorders, particularly those involving inflammation and degeneration of the joints. The presence of swelling joints and movement stiffness points towards arthritis-related conditions. Among the options, \"arthritis\" best fits this symptom cluster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, joint pain, skin peeling, silver-like dusting, small dents in nails, and inflammatory nails. These are classic features of psoriasis, which often presents with silvery scales on the skin and nail changes such as pitting (small dents) and inflammation.\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include a widespread rash, intense itching, changes in skin color, and the presence of lumps and knot-like pimples. These are classic signs of a fungal infection, which often presents with itchy, discolored patches and sometimes raised lesions or bumps on the skin.\n",
      "Condition: fungal infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, sunken eyes, dehydration, and diarrhoea are commonly seen in cases of acute gastroenteritis, which is an infection or irritation of the digestive tract leading to these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of hepatitis, particularly the yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and abdominal pain, which are commonly seen in hepatitis infections.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, and abdominal pain. The combination of yellowish skin and dark urine suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of high fever and abdominal pain further supports a diagnosis of hepatitis. Among the hepatitis options, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis a, hepatitis d, or hepatitis e. However, the combination of weight loss and chronic symptoms is most characteristic of hepatitis c.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, mood swings, weight loss, sweating, diarrhea, fast heart rate, excessive hunger, muscle weakness, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), which can cause increased metabolism (weight loss, excessive hunger), increased sympathetic activity (fast heart rate, sweating), and menstrual irregularities.\n",
      "Condition: hyperthyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of jaundice, which is often associated with liver conditions. The yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice) point towards a hepatic issue. Among the options, hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E) and jaundice are possible, but \"jaundice\" is the most direct match for these symptoms as a syndrome.\n",
      "Condition: jaundice\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. Yellowish skin and eyes suggest jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a chronic or hereditary liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (various types) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The combination of these symptoms most closely matches hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B, C, D, or E, but without more specific symptoms (like route of transmission or acute vs chronic), the general presentation fits hepatitis B, which can have a family history component due to chronic carrier states.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, mood swings, weight loss, restlessness, sweating, diarrhoea, fast heart rate, excessive hunger, muscle weakness, irritability, and abnormal menstruation.

The presence of sneezing, runny nose, congestion, and loss of smell are particularly indicative of this condition.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: Frequent headaches and blurred vision are commonly associated with elevated blood pressure, which can lead to these symptoms. Among the conditions listed, 'hypertension' is most closely linked to these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hypertension\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of breathlessness, sweating, and chest pain are classic signs of a cardiac event, most notably a heart attack. These symptoms are not typical for respiratory infections, allergies, or other conditions in the list, but are hallmark features of myocardial infarction.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and gastrointestinal symptoms suggests a liver-related condition, most likely a form of hepatitis. The presence of joint pain and mild fever further supports this. Among the hepatitis types, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis a.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, yellowish skin (jaundice), abdominal pain, swelling and distention of the abdomen, fluid overload, and a history of alcohol consumption. These are classic signs of liver dysfunction, particularly related to chronic alcohol use, leading to liver damage and fluid accumulation (ascites).\n",
      "Condition: alcoholic hepatitis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, fever, generalized itching, jaundice (yellow skin), dark urine, and abdominal pain. These are classic signs of hepatitis, particularly acute viral hepatitis, which causes liver dysfunction leading to jaundice, dark urine, and systemic symptoms like fever and abdominal pain.\n",

      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, restlessness, lethargy, irregular sugar level, blurred and distorted vision, obesity, excessive hunger, increased appetite, and polyuria. These are classic symptoms of diabetes, particularly the irregular sugar level, polyuria (frequent urination), excessive hunger, and blurred vision.\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, headache, weakness of one body side, and altered sensorium. These are classic signs of a neurological event, particularly a stroke or brain hemorrhage, which can cause sudden weakness on one side of the body and changes in consciousness.\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, joint pain, skin peeling, silver-like dusting, small dents in nails, and inflammatory nails. These are classic features of psoriasis, which often presents with silvery scales on the skin and nail changes such as pitting (small dents) and inflammation.\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, and stomach bleeding. These are classic signs of severe hepatitis, particularly with jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes), liver failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Among the hepatitis types listed, these symptoms most closely match severe viral hepatitis, especially hepatitis B, C, D, or E. However, the presence of acute liver failure and coma is most commonly associated with hepatitis B.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include constipation, pain during bowel movements, pain in the anal region, bloody stool, and irritation in the anus. These are classic symptoms of hemorrhoids (piles), particularly when there is pain and bleeding associated with defecation.\n",
      "Condition: dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of back pain, weakness in limbs, dizziness, and loss of balance are commonly associated with nerve compression or issues related to the cervical spine.

These are classic signs of an underactive thyroid gland, which is characteristic of hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hypothyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include mood swings, weight loss, restlessness, sweating, diarrhea, fast heart rate, excessive hunger, muscle weakness, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an overactive thyroid gland, which increases metabolism and affects multiple body systems.\n",
      "Condition: hyperthyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, blisters, red sores around the nose, and yellow crust oozing. These are classic signs of a superficial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which is characterized by red sores that can rupture, ooze for a few days, and then form a yellowish-brown crust.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle wasting, patches in the throat, high fever, and a history of extra-marital contacts. These are suggestive of an immunocompromised state, possibly due to a sexually transmitted infection. The combination of muscle wasting and oral lesions (patches in throat) with high fever and risk factors (extra-marital contacts) is highly indicative of AIDS.\n",
      "Condition: aids\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, sunken eyes, dehydration, and diarrhoea are commonly seen in cases of acute gastroenteritis, which is an infection or irritation of the digestive tract leading to these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",

Among the options, these symptoms best fit with 'allergy', as allergies often present with itching, rashes, and skin eruptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: allergy\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, fatigue, weight loss, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, and abdominal pain. These are classic signs of liver dysfunction, particularly jaundice (yellowish skin, dark urine), and systemic symptoms like fatigue and weight loss. The presence of high fever and abdominal pain suggests an acute or chronic hepatitis. Among the hepatitis options, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis c, which is known for causing chronic liver disease with systemic symptoms and jaundice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include stomach pain, acidity, vomiting, cough, and chest pain. The combination of stomach pain, acidity, and vomiting points towards a gastrointestinal issue, and chest pain can be associated with acid reflux or peptic ulcer complications. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and peptic ulcer disease are both possibilities, but the presence of acidity and vomiting strongly suggests peptic ulcer disease.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, indigestion, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, passage of gases, and internal itching. These symptoms are commonly associated with gastrointestinal issues. Among the given conditions, \"gastroenteritis\" typically presents with vomiting, abdominal pain, and indigestion.

      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, stomach pain, burning micturition, and spotting during urination. Burning micturition and spotting during urination are classic signs of a urinary tract infection. Skin rash can sometimes occur due to systemic infection or as a reaction, but the combination of urinary symptoms points most strongly to a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of headache, weakness of one body side, and altered sensorium suggest a neurological event, most likely a stroke or brain hemorrhage, which can cause paralysis and changes in consciousness.\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, yellowish skin (jaundice), abdominal pain, swelling and distention of the abdomen, fluid overload, and a history of alcohol consumption. These are classic signs of liver dysfunction, particularly related to chronic alcohol use, leading to liver damage and fluid accumulation (ascites).\n",
      "Condition: alcoholic hepatitis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include sudden onset of lightheadedness, dizziness, headache, chest pain, and trouble with balance. These symptoms could point towards a cardiovascular or neurological event. The combination of chest pain and sudden dizziness with balance issues is concerning for a possible acute event such as a heart attack or a neurological event like a brain hemorrhage (which can cause paralysis and vertigo).

      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The presence of itchy rashes all over the body suggests a systemic skin reaction, which could be due to an allergy or a drug reaction. The additional symptoms of loss of appetite and feeling very tired (fatigue) point towards a systemic involvement. While allergies can cause rashes and sometimes fatigue, the combination of widespread rashes, loss of appetite, and significant fatigue is more characteristic of a drug reaction, which often presents with systemic symptoms in addition to skin manifestations.\n",
      "Condition: drug reaction\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include swollen legs, swollen blood vessels, prominent veins on the calf, and obesity. These are classic signs of venous insufficiency, particularly varicose veins. Fatigue and cramps can also be associated with poor venous return in the legs, and bruising may occur due to fragile veins.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, loss of appetite, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, and blood in sputum. The combination of cough, blood in sputum, chest pain, fever, night sweats, and weight loss (loss of appetite, malaise) is highly suggestive of tuberculosis. Yellowing of eyes can sometimes be seen in advanced cases due to liver involvement or other complications.\n",

These symptoms are commonly associated with cardiovascular issues, particularly those affecting blood flow to the brain, which can result in dizziness and loss of balance. Chest pain is a key symptom of heart attack, and the combination with headache and dizziness further supports a cardiovascular cause rather than a neurological or infectious one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fever, back pain, rashes on arms and neck, and pain behind the eyes. This combination, especially the presence of fever, rashes, and retro-orbital pain (pain behind the eyes), is characteristic of dengue infection.\n",
      "Condition: dengue\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are sneezing, bad cough, weakness, exhaustion, and high temperature (fever). These are classic symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, commonly known as the common cold. Other conditions like pneumonia or bronchial asthma could present with cough, but sneezing and the overall symptom pattern fit best with the common cold.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, headache, nausea, spinning movements, loss of balance, and unsteadiness. These are classic signs of vertigo, particularly positional vertigo, which is characterized by spinning sensations and balance issues.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching and skin rash, which can be seen in allergies or infections, but the presence of burning micturition and spotting during urination points towards a urinary tract issue rather than a generalized allergic reaction or skin condition. These urinary symptoms are classic for a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include stomach pain, acidity, vomiting, cough, and chest pain. The combination of stomach pain, acidity, vomiting, and chest pain points towards a gastrointestinal issue, particularly one involving acid reflux or ulceration. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and peptic ulcer disease are both possibilities, but the presence of acidity and chest pain is more characteristic of GERD, which can also cause cough due to acid irritating the esophagus and respiratory tract.\n",
      "Condition: gerd\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of burning micturition, bladder discomfort, and a continuous feeling of needing to urinate are classic signs of a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cough, high fever, family history, and mucoid sputum. These are classic symptoms of a respiratory infection, particularly tuberculosis, which often presents with cough, fever, fatigue, and sputum production, and can have a family history component due to close contact transmission.\n",
      "Condition: tuberculosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of constipation, pain during bowel movements, pain in the anal region, and irritation in the anus are commonly associated with hemorrhoids (piles), particularly when they are described as \"dimorphic\" which refers to both internal and external types.\n",
      "Condition: dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms describedâ€”chills, nausea, high temperature (fever), headache, sweating, and muscle achesâ€”are classic for an acute febrile illness. These symptoms are commonly seen in malaria, which is characterized by periodic fevers, chills, sweating, headache, and muscle aches.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, cough, high fever, headache, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, phlegm, throat irritation, redness of eyes, sinus pressure, runny nose, congestion, chest pain, loss of smell, and muscle pain.

      "\n",
      "Condition: allergy\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, pus-filled pimples, blackheads, and scurring. These are classic signs of a skin condition characterized by blocked pores, inflammation, and sometimes infection, which is typical of acne.\n",
      "Condition: acne\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include swollen legs, swollen blood vessels, prominent veins on the calf, cramps, and fatigue. These are classic signs of venous insufficiency, particularly varicose veins, which are characterized by prominent, swollen veins, especially in the legs, and can be associated with cramps, fatigue, and sometimes bruising and obesity as risk factors.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver issue. Among the options, hepatitis (various types) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The most likely condition from the list that matches these symptoms is hepatitis, and since the type is not specified but family history is mentioned, hepatitis b is a likely candidate as it can be chronic and familial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",

      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, mood swings, weight loss, restlessness, sweating, diarrhoea, fast heart rate, muscle weakness, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism), which can cause increased metabolism, emotional changes, and menstrual irregularities.\n",
      "Condition: hyperthyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include back pain, weakness in limbs, neck pain, dizziness, and loss of balance. These are commonly associated with nerve compression or issues in the cervical spine, which can lead to neurological symptoms such as weakness and balance problems.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The yellowish skin and eyes suggest jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E), alcoholic hepatitis, and chronic cholestasis are possible. However, the combination of jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite is most characteristic of hepatitis, and the family history could suggest a chronic form like hepatitis B or C. Since the specific type is not mentioned, but hepatitis C is often associated with chronicity and family history, it is the most likely.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, pus-filled pimples, blackheads, and scurring. These are classic signs of a skin condition characterized by pimples and comedones, commonly known as acne.\n",
      "Condition: acne\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include pain and stiffness in the neck, narrowing of the spinal canal, tingling, numbness, weakness in the limbs, lack of coordination, difficulty walking, and loss of bladder or bowel control. These are classic signs of cervical spondylosis, especially when there is nerve root or spinal cord compression.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of hepatitis, particularly the yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and abdominal pain, which are commonly seen in hepatitis infections.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, blisters, and yellow crust ooze. These are characteristic of a bacterial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which often presents with honey-colored (yellow) crusts over blisters and is associated with fever and rash.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, and stomach bleeding. The combination of jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes), liver failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggests a severe hepatitis infection. Among the hepatitis types, hepatitis B, C, D, and E can cause acute liver failure, but the presence of joint pain is more characteristic of hepatitis B. However, hepatitis C can also present with joint pain but is less likely to cause acute liver failure acutely. Hepatitis A and E are more likely to cause acute symptoms, but hepatitis B is classically associated with joint pain and severe liver involvement.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, breathlessness, sweating, and chest pain are classic signs of a cardiac event, particularly a heart attack. These symptoms together are not typical for respiratory, gastrointestinal, or infectious diseases, but are highly suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain, swelling of the stomach, distention of the abdomen, history of alcohol consumption, and fluid overload. These symptoms are commonly associated with liver disease due to chronic alcohol use, particularly alcoholic hepatitis, which can cause abdominal swelling (ascites), pain, and fluid overload.\n",
      "Condition: alcoholic hepatitis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include acidity, indigestion, headache, excessive hunger, stiff neck, depression, irritability, and visual disturbances. Among the conditions listed, \"migraine\" is characterized by headache and visual disturbances, and can also be associated with gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea or indigestion, as well as mood changes such as depression and irritability.

      "Condition: tuberculosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are difficulty breathing, productive cough with a lot of mucous, and fatigue/weakness. These symptoms are commonly associated with respiratory infections or conditions affecting the lungs. Among the options provided, \"pneumonia\" best fits this presentation, as it typically presents with cough (often productive), difficulty breathing, and systemic symptoms like fatigue and weakness.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of continuous sneezing, chills, and watering from eyes are commonly associated with upper respiratory tract infections, particularly viral infections like the common cold. These symptoms are not specific to allergies (which would usually lack chills), nor do they fit other conditions in the list.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, yellowish skin (jaundice), abdominal pain, swelling and distention of the abdomen, fluid overload, and a history of alcohol consumption. These are classic signs of liver dysfunction, particularly related to chronic alcohol use, leading to liver damage and subsequent symptoms such as ascites (fluid overload), jaundice, and abdominal swelling.\n",
      "Condition: alcoholic hepatitis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, indigestion, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, passage of gases, and internal itching. These symptoms are commonly associated with gastrointestinal issues. Among the given conditions, \"gastroenteritis\" is characterized by vomiting, abdominal pain, and indigestion. \"Peptic ulcer disease\" can also present with abdominal pain and indigestion, but vomiting and internal itching are less typical. \"Gastroesophageal reflux disease\" (GERD) usually presents with heartburn and regurgitation rather than vomiting and internal itching. \"Gastroenteritis\" best fits the combination of gastrointestinal symptoms including vomiting and abdominal pain.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cold hands and feet, mood swings, lethargy, dizziness, puffy face and eyes, enlarged thyroid, brittle nails, swollen extremities, depression, irritability, and abnormal menstruation.

      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, neck pain, knee pain, hip joint pain, swelling of joints, and painful walking. These are characteristic of a degenerative joint disease affecting multiple joints, commonly seen in osteoarthritis.\n",
      "Condition: osteoarthristis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are increased thirst (polydipsia), increased urination (polyuria), dry mouth and throat, and increased hunger (polyphagia). These are classic symptoms of high blood sugar and are commonly seen in diabetes.\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, breathlessness, sweating, and chest pain are classic signs of a cardiac event, particularly a heart attack. These symptoms together strongly suggest an acute coronary syndrome rather than other conditions on the list.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, sunken eyes, dehydration, and diarrhoea are commonly seen in cases of acute gastroenteritis, which is an infection or irritation of the digestive tract leading to these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms can be seen in several conditions, but the combination of chest pain, dizziness, and loss of balance is particularly concerning for a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack. Headache and lack of concentration can also occur due to reduced blood flow to the brain during such an event.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include migraines/headaches, insomnia, muscle twitching/trembling, and dizziness. These symptoms are most consistent with hyperthyroidism, which can cause neurological symptoms (tremors, insomnia, headaches, dizziness) due to increased metabolic activity.\n",
      "Condition: hyperthyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, and stomach bleeding. These are classic signs of severe hepatitis, particularly with acute liver failure and jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes). The presence of joint pain and high fever can be seen in hepatitis B, but the overall picture fits hepatitis B or hepatitis C. However, hepatitis B is more commonly associated with acute liver failure and the listed symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include mood swings, trouble concentrating, mental fog, excessive thirst, and frequent urination. Excessive thirst and frequent urination are classic symptoms of diabetes, and mental fog can also be associated with blood sugar fluctuations.\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, joint pain, skin peeling, silver-like dusting, small dents in nails, and inflammatory nails. These are classic features of psoriasis, which often presents with silvery scales on the skin and nail changes such as pitting (small dents) and inflammation.\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The main symptoms are a widespread red, swollen rash and loss of appetite. These symptoms are commonly seen in allergic reactions or drug reactions, but the description of a rash that is red, swollen, and worse in some areas is more typical of an allergic reaction. There is no mention of fever, joint pain, or other systemic symptoms that would suggest infections like chicken pox, dengue, or impetigo. The absence of respiratory symptoms or gastrointestinal symptoms also makes other conditions less likely.\n",
      "Condition: allergy\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include a dry cough, trouble breathing, weakness, and tiredness. These symptoms are commonly associated with respiratory conditions. Among the options, \"bronchial asthma\" is characterized by cough and difficulty breathing, but it is usually associated with wheezing and may not always cause weakness and tiredness. \"Pneumonia\" can present with cough, difficulty breathing, and systemic symptoms like weakness and tiredness, but the cough is often productive. \"Tuberculosis\" can cause a chronic cough, weakness, and tiredness, but usually lasts longer than a week. \"Common cold\" can cause cough and tiredness, but trouble breathing is less common. Given the acute onset and the combination of respiratory and systemic symptoms, \"bronchial asthma\" is the most fitting among the options.\n",

      "Condition: allergy\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include bloating, weight loss, loss of appetite, bloody vomit, and dark, tarry stools. Bloody vomit and dark stools (melena) are classic signs of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, often associated with peptic ulcers. The chronic nature of the symptoms, along with weight loss and loss of appetite, further supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain. The presence of yellowish skin and dark urine suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with hepatitis. The combination of these symptoms is most consistent with hepatitis, and since joint pain is more commonly seen in hepatitis B, but can also be present in hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E, the most likely condition from the list that matches all these symptoms is hepatitis b.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include jaundice (yellowing of eyes and urine), fatigue, malaise, abdominal pain, and a history of receiving blood transfusions or unsterile injections, which are risk factors for viral hepatitis. These features are most consistent with hepatitis C from the list provided.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E), chronic cholestasis, and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The symptoms best fit hepatitis, and since family history is mentioned, hepatitis B or C are more likely. Hepatitis A is usually acute and not associated with family history. Hepatitis B is often associated with family transmission.\n",

Among the conditions listed, gastroenteritis is characterized by vomiting and diarrhoea, which can lead to dehydration (manifested as sunken eyes).\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The combination of chest pain, breathlessness, and vomiting are classic symptoms that can be seen in a heart attack. These symptoms are less likely to be explained by other conditions in the list, as they point towards an acute cardiac event.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cramps, bruising, obesity, swollen legs, swollen blood vessels, and prominent veins on the calf. These are classic signs of venous insufficiency, particularly varicose veins, which are characterized by swollen, twisted veins visible under the skin, most commonly in the legs, and are often associated with swelling, cramps, and fatigue.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include cough, chills (freezing), nasal congestion, facial pain, productive cough (coughing up nasty stuff), chest pain, muscle aches, and loss of smell. These symptoms are most consistent with a respiratory infection. Among the conditions listed, \"common cold\" fits best, as it commonly presents with nasal congestion, cough, facial pain (from sinus congestion), muscle aches, and loss of smell.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include stomach pain, ulcers on the tongue, vomiting, cough, and chest pain. The presence of stomach pain and ulcers on the tongue, along with vomiting, points towards a gastrointestinal issue. Chest pain and cough could be associated with reflux of stomach contents into the esophagus, which can also cause ulcers in the mouth and chest discomfort. These symptoms are most consistent with peptic ulcer disease, which can present with stomach pain, vomiting, and sometimes chest pain due to acid reflux. The ulcers on the tongue can be a result of acid exposure or nutritional deficiencies secondary to the ulcer disease.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, mood swings, weight loss, restlessness, sweating, diarrhea, fast heart rate, excessive hunger, muscle weakness, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an overactive thyroid, which is known as hyperthyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hyperthyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, neck pain, knee pain, hip joint pain, and painful walking.

This matches the typical presentation of osteoarthritis.\n",
      "Condition: osteoarthristis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include visible varicose veins on the legs, discomfort, and cramps during physical activity. These are classic signs of varicose veins, which are enlarged, twisted veins often seen in the legs and can cause discomfort and cramping.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of terrible stomach pains, vomiting, and constipation suggest a gastrointestinal issue. Among the conditions listed, \"peptic ulcer disease\" and \"peptic ulcer diseae\" are present, but peptic ulcers typically cause pain and sometimes vomiting, but not usually constipation. \"Gastroenteritis\" usually causes vomiting and diarrhea, not constipation. \"Gastroesophageal reflux disease\" (GERD) can cause stomach pain and vomiting, but constipation is not a classic symptom. The combination of these symptoms does not perfectly fit any single condition, but \"peptic ulcer disease\" is the closest match given the severe stomach pain and vomiting.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain. The presence of yellowish skin and dark urine suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with hepatitis. The combination of these symptoms is most consistent with hepatitis, and since joint pain is more commonly associated with hepatitis B, C, and E, but the list includes hepatitis a, b, c, d, and e, the most likely is hepatitis b or c. However, joint pain is a classic feature of hepatitis b.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (various types) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The most likely condition from the list that matches these symptoms is hepatitis, and since the type is not specified but family history is present, hepatitis b is a strong candidate as it can be chronic and familial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The presence of small red spots all over the body, along with tiredness and a mild fever every night, suggests a systemic infection.

      "Condition: dengue\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, nausea, spinning movements, loss of balance, and unsteadiness. These are classic signs of vertigo, particularly positional vertigo, which is characterized by a sensation of spinning and balance disturbances.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include acidity, indigestion, headache, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, stiff neck, irritability, and visual disturbances. The combination of headache, visual disturbances, and irritability is characteristic of migraine. Other conditions in the list do not typically present with this specific cluster of symptoms, especially the visual disturbances and headache together.\n",
      "Condition: migraine\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, pus-filled pimples, blackheads, and scurring. These are classic signs of a skin condition characterized by pimples and comedones, which is commonly known as acne.\n",
      "Condition: acne\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, fast heart rate, and rusty sputum. These are classic signs of a lower respiratory tract infection, particularly pneumonia. Rusty sputum is especially characteristic of pneumonia, often due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. The combination of fever, chest pain, breathlessness, and productive cough with colored sputum further supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, fatigue, lethargy, high fever, loss of appetite, mild fever, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, and red spots over the body. These are classic symptoms of chicken pox, which typically presents with fever, malaise, and a characteristic rash with red spots over the body, often accompanied by itching and sometimes swollen lymph nodes.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are joint pain and peeling skin. Joint pain is commonly associated with arthritis, and peeling skin can sometimes occur in certain types of arthritis due to inflammation or associated skin conditions. Other conditions in the list do not typically present with both joint pain and peeling skin together.\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include jaundice (yellowish skin, yellowing of eyes, yellow urine), fatigue, malaise, abdominal pain, and risk factors such as receiving blood transfusions and unsterile injections. These are classic features of viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C, which is commonly transmitted through blood and can present with these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include a sore on the nose that has crusted over, is hard to touch, and previously leaked a yellow-rust colored fluid. These are classic signs of a superficial skin infection, particularly one that forms honey-colored crusts, which is characteristic of impetigo.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of jaundice, which is often associated with liver conditions. The yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice), along with abdominal pain and loss of appetite, are particularly indicative of hepatitis.

      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include itchiness, rashy spots, areas of skin with different shades, and hard bumps. These are classic signs of a skin infection, particularly a fungal infection, which often presents with itching, discoloration, and raised lesions.\n",
      "Condition: fungal infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, stomach pain, and burning micturition. Itching and skin rash suggest a dermatological or allergic issue, while burning micturition points towards a urinary tract problem. However, the combination of skin symptoms and burning micturition is most commonly seen in drug reactions, where multiple organ systems can be affected, including the skin and urinary tract. Stomach pain can also be a part of a systemic drug reaction.\n",
      "Condition: drug reaction\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, yellowish skin (jaundice), swelling and distention of the abdomen, history of alcohol consumption, and fluid overload. These are classic signs of liver dysfunction, particularly related to chronic alcohol use, leading to liver damage and subsequent complications such as ascites (fluid overload and abdominal swelling).\n",
      "Condition: alcoholic hepatitis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, stomach pain, burning micturition, and spotting during urination. Burning micturition and spotting during urination are classic signs of a urinary tract infection. The presence of skin symptoms could be due to irritation or a secondary effect, but the urinary symptoms are most specific.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, chills, joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, pain behind the eyes, back pain, malaise, muscle pain, and red spots over the body. This combination, especially the presence of high fever, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and red spots (petechiae), is characteristic of dengue fever.\n",
      "Condition: dengue\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, fatigue, anxiety, sweating, headache, nausea, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, drying and tingling lips, slurred speech, irritability, and palpitations. These symptoms are characteristic of low blood sugar levels, which can cause neurological and autonomic symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, irritability, slurred speech, and excessive hunger. This matches the clinical presentation of hypoglycemia.\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include burning micturition, bladder discomfort, foul smell of urine, and a continuous feeling of needing to urinate. These are classic signs of a urinary tract infection.\n",

      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are swollen legs with dark purple veins, which are classic signs of varicose veins. There is no mention of pain, redness, or other systemic symptoms that would suggest other conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or infection. The description fits best with varicose veins from the provided list.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include stomach pain, acidity, ulcers on the tongue, vomiting, cough, and chest pain. The combination of stomach pain, acidity, vomiting, and ulcers on the tongue points towards a gastrointestinal issue, particularly one involving acid. Chest pain and cough could be related to acid reflux affecting the esophagus. The most fitting condition from the list that matches these symptoms is peptic ulcer disease.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms can be associated with several conditions, but the combination of chest pain, dizziness, and loss of balance is particularly concerning for a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack. Headache and lack of concentration can also occur during such an event due to reduced blood flow to the brain.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle weakness, stiff neck, swelling of joints, movement stiffness, and painful walking.

      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, yellowish skin, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of jaundice, which is often associated with liver conditions such as hepatitis. The presence of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), along with abdominal pain and loss of appetite, strongly suggests a liver-related disorder. Among the options, hepatitis a, hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis d, hepatitis e, and jaundice are possible. However, \"jaundice\" is the most direct match for these symptoms as it describes the syndrome itself.\n",
      "Condition: jaundice\n",
      "Reasoning: The presence of a rash with peeling skin suggests a skin-related issue, possibly an infection or immune-related. Increased susceptibility to illnesses points toward a compromised immune system. Shakiness and hand tremors could be due to metabolic or systemic issues. Among the options, \"aids\" is known for causing immunosuppression, making individuals more susceptible to infections, including skin manifestations like rashes and peeling. Shakiness can also occur due to systemic effects of the disease.\n",
      "Condition: aids\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold hands and feet, mood swings, lethargy, dizziness, puffy face and eyes, enlarged thyroid, brittle nails, swollen extremities, depression, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an underactive thyroid gland, which is consistent with hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hypothyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cramps, bruising, obesity, swollen legs, swollen blood vessels, and prominent veins on the calf.

      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are rash all over the body, feeling very sick, fever, and headache. These symptoms are commonly seen in viral infections such as chicken pox, dengue, or drug reactions. However, chicken pox typically presents with a rash and systemic symptoms like fever and headache. Dengue can also present with rash, fever, and headache, but the rash in dengue is usually not as prominent as in chicken pox. Drug reaction can also cause rash and systemic symptoms, but without a history of new medication, it is less likely. Chicken pox is characterized by a widespread rash, fever, and malaise.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of bladder discomfort, foul smell of urine, and a continuous feeling of needing to urinate are classic signs of a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, headache, nausea, loss of balance, and unsteadiness are characteristic of vertigo, specifically paroxysmal positional vertigo, which often presents with these symptoms due to disturbances in the inner ear or vestibular system.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and weakness are common in several conditions, but they are particularly characteristic of hepatitis (such as hepatitis A, B, C, D, or E), gastroenteritis, and sometimes malaria or typhoid. However, the absence of fever, jaundice, or specific gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea makes gastroenteritis less likely. The symptoms fit best with hepatitis, but without more specific signs (like jaundice), it's challenging to specify the type. However, these symptoms are classic for hepatitis A.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggests a form of hepatitis. The presence of joint pain and mild fever is more characteristic of hepatitis B, C, or E. However, hepatitis B and C are more chronic, while hepatitis E often presents acutely with these symptoms, especially in adults. Hepatitis A can also present similarly, but joint pain is more commonly associated with hepatitis E.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis e\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, fatigue, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, and stomach bleeding. These are classic signs of severe hepatitis, particularly with jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes), liver failure, and associated complications. Among the hepatitis types listed, these symptoms are most consistent with severe viral hepatitis, and the presence of acute liver failure and coma suggests a fulminant course, which can be seen in hepatitis B, C, D, or E. However, hepatitis B is well-known for causing acute liver failure and severe complications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",

These are classic symptoms of diabetes, particularly the irregular sugar level, polyuria (frequent urination), excessive hunger, and blurred vision.\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The yellowish skin and eyes suggest jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (various types) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The combination of symptoms most closely matches hepatitis, and since the type is not specified but family history is present, hepatitis b is a likely candidate as it can be transmitted vertically and has a chronic course.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, high fever, sweating, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and muscle pain.

      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle weakness, stiff neck, swelling joints, and painful walking. These are commonly associated with joint and musculoskeletal disorders. Swelling joints and painful walking are classic signs of arthritis, and muscle weakness and stiff neck can also be present in some forms of arthritis.\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The combination of headache, chest pain, dizziness, and trouble concentrating could be seen in several conditions, but these symptoms together are most concerning for a cardiovascular issue, particularly a heart attack, as chest pain and dizziness are classic symptoms. Headache and trouble concentrating can also occur due to reduced blood flow or oxygenation during a cardiac event.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, blackheads, and scurring. Blackheads are a type of comedone commonly associated with acne. Skin rash and scurring (likely referring to scarring or crusting) can also be seen in acne.\n",

Yellowish skin suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The combination of gastrointestinal symptoms and jaundice points towards a form of hepatitis.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include jaundice (yellowish skin, yellowing of eyes, yellow urine), fatigue, malaise, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and risk factors such as receiving blood transfusions and unsterile injections. These are classic features of viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C, which is commonly transmitted through blood and unsterile injections.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include patches in the throat, high fever, and a history of extra-marital contacts. Patches in the throat and high fever can be seen in various infections, but the mention of extra-marital contacts suggests a risk factor for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS, which can present with such symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: aids\n",
      "Reasoning: The presence of small red sores near the nose and neck that are painful and inflamed, along with a high fever, suggests a bacterial skin infection.

      "Condition: migraine\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include frequent urination, painful urination, small amounts of urine, cloudy and bloody urine, foul smell, and nausea. These are classic signs of a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The combination of vomiting, breathlessness, and sweating are classic symptoms that can be seen in a heart attack. These symptoms together are less likely to be explained by other conditions in the list, and are typical of acute coronary syndrome.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of itching, skin rash, and dischromic patches are commonly associated with allergic reactions or skin infections. Among the options, these symptoms best fit with 'fungal infection', which often presents with itching, rash, and changes in skin pigmentation (dischromic patches).\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: fungal infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of headache, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration are commonly associated with vertigo, particularly benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is characterized by episodes of dizziness and balance issues. These symptoms do not specifically point to other conditions in the list such as migraine (which would typically include more severe headache and possibly visual disturbances), or hypoglycemia (which would often include sweating, palpitations, and hunger). The combination of dizziness and loss of balance is most characteristic of vertigo.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, cough, runny nose, congestion, throat irritation, sinus pressure, and loss of smell, which are classic symptoms of a respiratory infection. Additional symptoms like chills, fatigue, high fever, headache, malaise, swelled lymph nodes, phlegm, redness of eyes, chest pain, and muscle pain suggest a viral upper respiratory tract infection. Among the given conditions, 'common cold' best fits this symptom cluster.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, sunken eyes, dehydration, and diarrhoea are commonly seen in cases of acute gastroenteritis, which is an infection or irritation of the digestive tract leading to these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include high fever for several days, thick saliva, dry cough, and weakness. These are commonly seen in respiratory infections. Among the options, pneumonia is characterized by high fever, cough (which can be dry or productive), and general weakness. The thick saliva can be due to dehydration from fever and cough.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle weakness, stiff neck, swelling of joints, movement stiffness, and painful walking.

      "Reasoning: The symptoms include constipation, pain during bowel movements, pain in the anal region, bloody stool, and irritation in the anus. These are classic symptoms of hemorrhoids (piles), particularly when there is pain and bleeding associated with defecation.\n",
      "Condition: dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include persistent cough, high fever, difficulty breathing, and production of mucus. These are classic signs of a lower respiratory tract infection, most notably pneumonia. Other conditions like bronchial asthma or tuberculosis could present with cough and breathing difficulty, but the presence of high fever and productive cough with mucus strongly points towards pneumonia.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, pus-filled pimples, and scurring (likely referring to crusting or scabbing). These are classic signs of a superficial bacterial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which is characterized by pustules and honey-colored crusts.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, and stomach bleeding. These are classic signs of severe hepatitis, particularly with acute liver failure and jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes). Among the hepatitis types listed, hepatitis B, C, D, and E can cause acute liver failure, but hepatitis B is especially known for causing fulminant hepatitis with these severe symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: Blood in urine (hematuria), low-grade fever, headaches, strong urge to urinate, and lower back pain are classic symptoms of a urinary tract infection. The combination of urinary symptoms and back pain suggests possible involvement of the upper urinary tract (such as pyelonephritis), but the primary condition is a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include intense itching, rashy areas, firm pimples, and patches of skin with a different color. These are classic signs of a skin condition, particularly one involving an external agent. The presence of itching and rash, along with color changes, points toward a superficial skin infection, most likely fungal in nature.\n",
      "Condition: fungal infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include stomach pain, acidity, ulcers on the tongue, vomiting, cough, and chest pain. The combination of stomach pain, acidity, vomiting, and ulcers on the tongue points towards a gastrointestinal issue, particularly one involving acid. Chest pain and cough could be related to acid reflux irritating the esophagus. These symptoms are most consistent with peptic ulcer disease, which can present with stomach pain, acidity, vomiting, and sometimes ulcers in the mouth due to acid exposure.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, mood swings, weight loss, restlessness, sweating, diarrhea, fast heart rate, excessive hunger, muscle weakness, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an overactive thyroid, which is known as hyperthyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hyperthyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, sunken eyes, dehydration, and diarrhoea are commonly seen in cases of acute gastroenteritis, which is an infection or irritation of the digestive tract leading to these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, neck pain, knee pain, hip joint pain, swelling of joints, and painful walking. These are classic symptoms of a degenerative joint disease affecting multiple joints, commonly seen in osteoarthritis.\n",
      "Condition: osteoarthristis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggests a form of hepatitis. The presence of joint pain and mild fever is more characteristic of hepatitis B, C, or E. However, hepatitis B and C are less likely to present acutely with diarrhoea and mild fever, while hepatitis E often presents with these symptoms, especially in adults. Hepatitis A can also present similarly, but joint pain is more commonly associated with hepatitis E.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis e\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, shivering, chills, and watering from eyes. These are classic symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, commonly known as the common cold.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cramps, bruising, obesity, swollen legs, and prominent veins on the calf. These are classic signs of venous insufficiency, particularly the presence of swollen legs and prominent veins on the calf, which are characteristic of varicose veins.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, fatigue, anxiety, sweating, headache, nausea, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, slurred speech, irritability, and palpitations. These symptoms are characteristic of low blood sugar levels, which can cause neurological and autonomic symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, irritability, slurred speech, and excessive hunger.\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, stomach pain, burning micturition, and spotting during urination. Burning micturition and spotting during urination are classic signs of a urinary tract infection. Skin rash can sometimes occur due to systemic infection or as a reaction, but the combination of urinary symptoms points most strongly to a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms are commonly associated with cardiovascular or neurological issues. Among the given conditions, 'heart attack' can present with chest pain, headache, dizziness, and loss of balance due to reduced blood flow to the brain. Other conditions like migraine or vertigo could explain some symptoms, but chest pain is more characteristic of a heart attack.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggests a form of hepatitis. The presence of joint pain and mild fever is more characteristic of hepatitis B, C, or E. However, hepatitis B and C are less likely to present acutely with diarrhoea and mild fever. Hepatitis E often presents with these symptoms, especially in the context of acute hepatitis with jaundice and gastrointestinal symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis e\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include tight and weak neck muscles, as well as joint stiffness that affects running and walking.

      "Condition: acne\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include acidity, indigestion, headache, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, stiff neck, depression, and irritability. Excessive hunger is a classic symptom of diabetes, and when combined with other symptoms like headache, blurred vision, and irritability, it points towards blood sugar dysregulation. Acidity and indigestion can also be seen in diabetes due to gastroparesis. Stiff neck is less specific but can sometimes be seen in metabolic disorders. The combination of these symptoms most closely matches diabetes from the list.\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include a rash that is itchy, has a different color than the rest of the skin, and is accompanied by firm pimples or breakouts.

      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include feeling run down (fatigue), trouble breathing, constant runny nose, throat mucus, and inflamed lymph nodes. These are common symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection, most often caused by viruses. The presence of a runny nose, throat mucus, and inflamed lymph nodes points towards a viral infection like the common cold rather than more severe conditions like bronchial asthma (which would have wheezing and not typically lymphadenopathy or runny nose), or allergies (which would not usually cause lymph node swelling).\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are more noticeable blood vessels in the legs and daily cramps. These are classic signs of varicose veins, which involve enlarged, twisted veins often visible under the skin, commonly in the legs, and can be associated with cramping.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, headache, nausea, spinning movements, loss of balance, and unsteadiness. These are classic signs of vertigo, particularly positional vertigo, which is characterized by spinning sensations and balance issues.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include acidity, ulcers on the tongue, vomiting, cough, and chest pain. Acidity and ulcers on the tongue suggest a gastrointestinal issue, and vomiting further supports this. Chest pain and cough could be associated with reflux of stomach contents irritating the esophagus and possibly the respiratory tract. These symptoms are most consistent with peptic ulcer disease or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, the presence of ulcers on the tongue and acidity points more towards peptic ulcer disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: Cracks in the palms and soles, painful bleeding, and peeling skin are classic symptoms of a chronic skin condition.

      "Reasoning: The symptoms of bladder discomfort, foul smell of urine, and a continuous feeling of needing to urinate are classic signs of a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, and stomach bleeding. The presence of yellowing of eyes, dark urine, and acute liver failure points towards a severe liver condition. The combination of these symptoms is most consistent with viral hepatitis, and the acute presentation with liver failure and bleeding suggests a severe form, which can be seen in hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, or hepatitis E. However, hepatitis B is well known for causing acute liver failure and can present with these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes.

      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include acidity, indigestion, headache, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, stiff neck, depression, irritability, and visual disturbances. The combination of headache, visual disturbances, and irritability is characteristic of migraine. Other conditions in the list do not typically present with this specific cluster of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: migraine\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggests a form of hepatitis. The presence of joint pain and mild fever is more characteristic of hepatitis B, C, or E. However, hepatitis B and C are more chronic, while hepatitis A and E are more acute and often present with these symptoms. Given the acute presentation with gastrointestinal symptoms and jaundice, hepatitis E is most likely.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis e\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of itching, skin rash, and nodal skin eruptions are commonly associated with allergic reactions or drug reactions. However, nodal skin eruptions are more characteristic of a drug reaction, which often presents with various types of skin eruptions, including nodules, along with itching and rash.\n",
      "Condition: drug reaction\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver issue. Among the options, hepatitis (various types) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The most likely condition from the list that matches these symptoms is hepatitis, and since the type is not specified, but family history can be significant in hepatitis B, hepatitis b is the most fitting.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include stomach pain, ulcers on the tongue, vomiting, cough, and chest pain. The combination of stomach pain, vomiting, and ulcers on the tongue points towards a gastrointestinal issue, particularly one involving ulceration. Chest pain and cough could be associated with reflux of stomach contents irritating the esophagus and respiratory tract. Among the options, \"peptic ulcer disease\" is most consistent with these symptoms, as it can cause stomach pain, vomiting, and sometimes ulcers in the mouth due to acid reflux, and chest pain due to esophageal involvement.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include a rash with little bumps that are itchy and painful, along with fever and fatigue. These symptoms are commonly seen in chicken pox, which typically presents with an itchy, blister-like rash, fever, and malaise.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cramps, bruising, obesity, swollen legs, and swollen blood vessels. These symptoms are commonly associated with poor venous return and circulatory issues in the lower limbs, which are characteristic of varicose veins.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, headache, nausea, loss of balance, and unsteadiness are characteristic of vertigo, particularly paroxysmal positional vertigo, which often presents with these symptoms due to disturbances in the inner ear or vestibular system.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",

      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, fatigue, anxiety, sweating, nausea, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, drying and tingling lips, slurred speech, irritability, and palpitations. These symptoms are characteristic of low blood sugar levels, which can cause neurological and autonomic symptoms such as slurred speech, irritability, palpitations, sweating, and excessive hunger.\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of constipation, pain during bowel movements, bloody stool, and irritation in the anus are commonly associated with hemorrhoids (piles), particularly when they are described as \"dimorphic\" (internal and external). These symptoms are not typical of other conditions in the list.\n",
      "Condition: dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, and stomach bleeding. The combination of jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes), liver failure, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggests a severe form of hepatitis. Among the hepatitis types, hepatitis B, C, D, and E can cause acute liver failure, but hepatitis B is particularly known for causing acute and fulminant hepatitis with these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, fast heart rate, and rusty sputum. These are classic signs of a lower respiratory tract infection, particularly pneumonia. Rusty sputum is especially characteristic of pneumonia, often due to Streptococcus pneumoniae.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, high fever, headache, loss of appetite, mild fever, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, and red spots over the body. These are classic symptoms of chicken pox, which typically presents with a skin rash (red spots), fever, malaise, and sometimes lymphadenopathy.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are feeling very sick and having a rash all over the body. Among the conditions listed, several can present with a rash and systemic symptoms, but \"drug reaction\" and \"allergy\" are most commonly associated with widespread rash and feeling unwell. However, \"drug reaction\" typically presents with a sudden onset of rash and systemic symptoms after exposure to a new medication, while \"allergy\" can also cause rash but is often associated with itching, swelling, or respiratory symptoms. Other infectious causes like \"chicken pox\" and \"dengue\" can also cause rash and systemic illness, but chicken pox usually has vesicular lesions and dengue often has high fever and severe body aches. Without more specific details, the most likely from the list for a sudden rash and feeling sick is \"drug reaction.\"\n",
      "Condition: drug reaction\n",
      "Reasoning: The main symptoms are trouble breathing (especially with exercise), sweating, flushed appearance, and recurrent yeast infections. Trouble breathing with exertion and sweating could suggest a cardiac or respiratory issue, but the recurrent yeast infections point towards an underlying immunocompromised state or metabolic disorder. Diabetes is known to cause increased susceptibility to infections (including yeast infections), and can also cause sweating and sometimes flushed skin. The breathing difficulty could be due to poor fitness or complications of diabetes.\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include mood swings, weight loss, restlessness, sweating, diarrhea, fast heart rate, excessive hunger, muscle weakness, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an overactive thyroid gland, which is characteristic of hyperthyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hyperthyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, restlessness, lethargy, irregular sugar level, blurred and distorted vision, obesity, excessive hunger, increased appetite, and polyuria. These are classic symptoms of diabetes, which is characterized by high blood sugar levels, increased hunger, frequent urination (polyuria), and sometimes weight loss despite increased appetite.\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include back pain, persistent cough, weakness in arms and legs, neck pain, dizziness, and trouble with balance. These symptoms are suggestive of a neurological or cervical spine issue, particularly with the involvement of neck pain, weakness in limbs, and balance problems, which are classic for cervical spondylosis.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle wasting, patches in the throat, and a history of extra-marital contacts. Muscle wasting and patches in the throat suggest immunosuppression and possible opportunistic infections. Extra-marital contacts increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections, particularly HIV/AIDS, which is known to cause immunosuppression leading to such symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: aids\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, family history, and mucoid sputum. These are classic symptoms of a respiratory infection, particularly one that is chronic and can be associated with a family history.

      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include indigestion, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, passage of gases, and internal itching. These are commonly associated with gastrointestinal issues, particularly those affecting the digestive tract. Among the given conditions, \"peptic ulcer disease\" and \"gastroesophageal reflux disease\" are possibilities, but \"peptic ulcer disease\" more specifically matches the combination of abdominal pain, indigestion, and loss of appetite.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, dehydration, and diarrhoea are commonly seen in infections of the gastrointestinal tract, which lead to loss of fluids and electrolytes. These are classic features of gastroenteritis.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, high fever, headache, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, toxic look (typhos), and belly pain. The presence of high fever, abdominal symptoms, and a toxic appearance (typhos) are classic for typhoid fever.\n",
      "Condition: typhoid\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, headache, weakness of one body side, and altered sensorium. These are classic signs of a neurological event, particularly a stroke or brain hemorrhage, where there is sudden weakness on one side of the body and changes in consciousness.\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, indigestion, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, passage of gases, and internal itching. These symptoms are commonly associated with gastrointestinal issues. Among the conditions listed, \"gastroenteritis\" typically presents with vomiting, abdominal pain, and indigestion. However, \"chronic cholestasis\" can also present with abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and internal itching (pruritus), which is a key feature due to bile salt accumulation. The presence of internal itching strongly suggests a liver or biliary condition rather than a simple gastrointestinal infection.\n",

      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, nausea, fatigue, fever, weight loss, dark urine (black pee), yellow rash (likely jaundice), and abdominal pain. These are classic signs of liver dysfunction, particularly hepatitis. The presence of jaundice and dark urine strongly suggest a hepatitis infection.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include acidity, indigestion, headache, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, stiff neck, depression, irritability, and visual disturbances. The combination of excessive hunger, visual disturbances, and irritability points towards a metabolic disorder, particularly one affecting blood sugar levels. These are classic symptoms of hypoglycemia, which can cause neurological symptoms (headache, blurred vision, irritability, depression) and autonomic symptoms (hunger, indigestion). Stiff neck is less typical but can occur due to neurological involvement in severe hypoglycemia.\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and red spots over the body.

      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, high fever, sweating, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and muscle pain. These are classic symptoms of a febrile illness with systemic involvement. The combination of chills, high fever, sweating, and muscle pain is particularly characteristic of malaria, which often presents with these symptoms due to the cyclical rupture of red blood cells. Other conditions in the list do not typically present with this exact constellation of symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, breathlessness, sweating, and chest pain are classic signs of a cardiac event, particularly a heart attack. These symptoms together are not typical for respiratory, gastrointestinal, or infectious diseases, but are highly suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The yellowish skin and eyes suggest jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (various types) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The combination of symptoms most closely matches hepatitis, which can present with these features.\n",
      "\n",

      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include itching, rash, discolored patches of skin, and nodules/pimples. These are classic signs of a fungal infection, which often presents with itchy, discolored, and sometimes raised or nodular skin lesions.\n",
      "Condition: fungal infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are severe joint pain, vomiting, and fever. These symptoms are commonly associated with dengue, which often presents with high fever, severe joint and muscle pain (sometimes called \"breakbone fever\"), and sometimes vomiting. The lack of response to standard fever medication also supports this, as dengue fever can be persistent and difficult to manage with typical antipyretics.\n",
      "Condition: dengue\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, joint pain, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, back pain, malaise, chills, and red spots over the body. This combination, especially the pain behind the eyes, high fever, rash, and muscle/joint pain, is characteristic of dengue.\n",
      "Condition: dengue\n",
      "Reasoning: Blood in urine (hematuria), frequent urination, lower back pain, low fever, and headache are classic symptoms of a urinary tract infection. The combination of urinary symptoms and systemic signs like fever and back pain suggests the infection may involve the upper urinary tract (possibly pyelonephritis).\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, high fever, yellowish skin, and abdominal pain. Yellowish skin suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The combination of high fever, abdominal pain, and other systemic symptoms points towards a hepatitis infection.

The combination of skin symptoms and gastrointestinal/urinary symptoms suggests a systemic response, which is more characteristic of a drug reaction than a localized allergy.\n",
      "Condition: drug reaction\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and abdominal pain suggests a liver-related condition. The presence of mild fever, joint pain, and muscle pain further supports a viral hepatitis infection. Among the hepatitis types, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis a, hepatitis d, or hepatitis e. However, hepatitis b is commonly associated with joint pain and the described symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and gastrointestinal symptoms suggests a liver-related condition. The presence of joint pain and muscle pain can also be seen in viral hepatitis. Among the hepatitis types listed, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis a, hepatitis d, or hepatitis e. However, joint pain is particularly common in hepatitis b.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, weight loss, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, loss of appetite, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, and blood in sputum. These symptoms are characteristic of tuberculosis, which often presents with chronic cough, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and sometimes hemoptysis (blood in sputum). The presence of swelled lymph nodes and malaise further supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "Condition: tuberculosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, fatigue, anxiety, sweating, headache, nausea, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, drying and tingling lips, slurred speech, irritability, and palpitations. These symptoms are characteristic of low blood sugar levels, which can cause neurological and autonomic symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, irritability, slurred speech, and excessive hunger. This matches the clinical presentation of hypoglycemia.\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include yellowish skin (jaundice), abdominal pain, swelling and distention of the abdomen, fluid overload, and a history of alcohol consumption. These are classic signs of liver dysfunction, particularly related to chronic alcohol use, leading to alcoholic hepatitis.\n",
      "Condition: alcoholic hepatitis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle wasting, patches in the throat, high fever, and a history of extra-marital contacts. These are classic features of a chronic immunodeficiency state, particularly one that is sexually transmitted. The presence of muscle wasting and oral lesions (patches in throat) along with high fever and risk factors (extra-marital contacts) strongly suggest a diagnosis of AIDS.\n",
      "Condition: aids\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include acidity, indigestion, headache, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, stiff neck, depression, irritability, and visual disturbances. The combination of headache, visual disturbances, and gastrointestinal symptoms points towards a neurological condition, possibly migraine, as migraines can present with gastrointestinal symptoms, visual disturbances (aura), and mood changes. Stiff neck can sometimes be associated with severe migraines. Other conditions in the list do not fit this combination as closely.\n",
      "Condition: migraine\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, high fever, sweating, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and muscle pain. These are classic symptoms of a febrile illness with systemic involvement. The combination of chills, high fever, sweating, and muscle pain is particularly characteristic of malaria, which often presents with these symptoms due to the cyclical rupture of red blood cells by the malaria parasite.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain. The presence of yellowish skin and dark urine suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with hepatitis. The combination of joint pain and these symptoms is particularly characteristic of hepatitis B.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of jaundice, which can be caused by various types of hepatitis. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), abdominal pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms is most consistent with hepatitis. Since the specific type is not mentioned, but these symptoms are common in hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E, I will select the most general and common one associated with acute onset and these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms describedâ€”sour taste in the mouth, frequent hiccups, and a sensation of a lump in the throatâ€”are commonly associated with acid reflux. This is characteristic of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), where stomach acid flows back into the esophagus, causing these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: gerd\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle wasting, patches in the throat, high fever, and a history of extra-marital contacts. These are classic features of a chronic immunodeficiency state, particularly one that is sexually transmitted. The presence of muscle wasting and oral lesions (patches in throat) along with high fever and risk factors (extra-marital contacts) strongly suggest HIV/AIDS.\n",
      "Condition: aids\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include stomach pain, acidity, ulcers on the tongue, vomiting, cough, and chest pain. The combination of stomach pain, acidity, vomiting, and ulcers on the tongue points towards a gastrointestinal issue, particularly one involving acid. Chest pain and cough could be related to acid reflux irritating the esophagus and respiratory tract. These symptoms are most consistent with peptic ulcer disease, which can present with stomach pain, vomiting, and sometimes oral ulcers due to acid. GERD is also possible, but the presence of ulcers on the tongue and the classic combination of symptoms fits peptic ulcer disease better.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The main symptom described is varicose veins in the legs, accompanied by pain, difficulty sleeping, and cramps during physical activity. These are classic symptoms of varicose veins, which are swollen, twisted veins that can cause discomfort and cramping, especially after standing or exertion.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain.

      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, fatigue, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of jaundice and liver dysfunction. Among the conditions listed, hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E) and jaundice are most closely associated with these symptoms. However, the combination of yellowish skin, yellowing of eyes, dark urine, and abdominal pain is most characteristic of hepatitis.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include constipation, pain in the anal region, bloody stool, and irritation in the anus. These are classic symptoms of hemorrhoids (piles), particularly when there is bleeding and discomfort in the anal area.\n",
      "Condition: dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms are commonly associated with cardiovascular or neurological issues. Among the given conditions, 'heart attack' can present with chest pain, dizziness, and sometimes headache. However, the combination of dizziness, loss of balance, and headache is more characteristic of a vestibular disorder such as '(vertigo) paroymsal positional vertigo', which specifically includes dizziness and loss of balance as key symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, high fever, headache, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, toxic look (typhos), and belly pain. The presence of high fever, abdominal symptoms, and a toxic look (typhos) are classic for typhoid fever.\n",
      "Condition: typhoid\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include constipation, pain during bowel movements, pain in the anal region, bloody stool, and irritation in the anus. These are classic symptoms of hemorrhoids (piles), particularly when there is pain and bleeding associated with bowel movements.\n",

      "Reasoning: The symptoms include jaundice (yellowish skin, yellowing of eyes, yellow urine), fatigue, malaise, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and risk factors such as receiving blood transfusions and unsterile injections. These are classic features of viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C, which is commonly transmitted through blood and unsterile injections.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, blisters, red sores around the nose, and yellow crust oozing. These are classic signs of a superficial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which is characterized by red sores that can rupture, ooze for a few days, and then form a yellowish-brown crust.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, high fever, headache, loss of appetite, mild fever, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, and red spots over the body. These are classic symptoms of chicken pox, which typically presents with a skin rash, fever, malaise, and red spots (vesicular rash) over the body.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, and abdominal pain. The combination of yellowish skin and dark urine suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of high fever and abdominal pain further supports a liver infection. Among the hepatitis options, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis a, hepatitis d, or hepatitis e. However, the combination of weight loss and chronic symptoms is most characteristic of hepatitis c.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, coma, and stomach bleeding. The combination of jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes), dark urine, abdominal pain, and systemic symptoms like fever and fatigue point towards a severe liver condition. The presence of coma and stomach bleeding suggests advanced liver dysfunction, which is characteristic of severe hepatitis. Among the hepatitis types, hepatitis B, C, D, and E can cause severe symptoms, but hepatitis B is well-known for causing fulminant hepatitis with these complications.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold hands and feet, mood swings, lethargy, dizziness, puffy face and eyes, enlarged thyroid, brittle nails, swollen extremities, depression, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an underactive thyroid gland, which is known as hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hypothyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include trouble breathing, sweating, sore throat, excessive mucus, rapid heart rate, chest pain, and coughing up red (likely blood). These symptoms are most consistent with a severe respiratory infection, possibly with lung involvement. Coughing up blood (hemoptysis), chest pain, and difficulty breathing are classic signs of pneumonia.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include a bad cold, persistent cough, blocked sinuses, loss of smell, chest pain, and muscle aches. These are classic symptoms of a common viral upper respiratory infection, commonly known as the common cold.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. The combination of dark urine, yellowing of eyes (jaundice), abdominal pain, and loss of appetite is characteristic of hepatitis. Joint pain is also commonly seen in some types of hepatitis. Among the hepatitis types listed, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis a, hepatitis d, or hepatitis e. However, joint pain is particularly associated with hepatitis b.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cough, high fever, family history, and mucoid sputum. These are classic symptoms of a respiratory infection, particularly tuberculosis, which often presents with cough, fever, fatigue, and sputum production, and can have a family history component due to close contact transmission.\n",
      "Condition: tuberculosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include constipation, pain during bowel movements, pain in the anal region, bloody stool, and irritation in the anus. These are classic symptoms of hemorrhoids (piles), particularly when there is pain and bleeding associated with defecation.\n",
      "Condition: dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headaches, chest pain, dizziness, trouble concentrating, and feeling off balance. These symptoms are commonly associated with (vertigo) paroymsal positional vertigo, which often presents with dizziness and imbalance. However, chest pain can also be a sign of a heart attack, but the combination with dizziness and off balance points more towards vertigo.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, and stomach bleeding. These are classic signs of severe hepatitis, particularly with acute liver failure and jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes). Among the hepatitis types listed, hepatitis B, C, D, A, and E are present. The presence of acute liver failure and severe symptoms like coma and stomach bleeding are most commonly associated with hepatitis B.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cramps, bruising, obesity, swollen legs, swollen blood vessels, and prominent veins on the calf. These are classic signs of venous insufficiency, particularly varicose veins, which are characterized by swollen, twisted veins visible under the skin, most commonly in the legs, and can cause swelling, cramps, and fatigue.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The yellowish skin and eyes suggest jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (various types) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The combination of symptoms best fits hepatitis, and since the type is not specified but family history is present, hepatitis b is a likely candidate as it can be transmitted vertically and has a chronic course.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, headache, weakness of one body side, and altered sensorium. These are classic signs of a neurological event, particularly a stroke or brain hemorrhage, where there is sudden weakness on one side of the body and changes in consciousness.\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, loss of appetite, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, and blood in sputum. These symptoms are characteristic of tuberculosis, which often presents with chronic cough, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and sometimes hemoptysis (blood in sputum). Swollen lymph nodes and malaise further support this diagnosis.\n",
      "Condition: tuberculosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include weight loss, persistent pain and discomfort relieved by antacids, and a terrible feeling in the mouth. These are classic signs of peptic ulcer disease, where ulcers in the stomach or duodenum cause pain that is often relieved by antacids, and chronic ulcers can lead to weight loss and oral discomfort.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include a stuffy nose, red and watery eyes, difficulty breathing, chest pain, muscle soreness, and loss of smell. These are classic symptoms of a common viral upper respiratory infection, commonly known as the common cold. The presence of nasal congestion, red/watery eyes, and anosmia (loss of smell) are particularly characteristic of the common cold.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, fast heart rate, and rusty sputum. These are classic signs of a lower respiratory tract infection, particularly pneumonia. Rusty sputum is especially characteristic of pneumonia, often due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. The combination of fever, cough, chest pain, and breathlessness further supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, indigestion, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, passage of gases, and internal itching. These symptoms are commonly associated with gastrointestinal issues. Among the conditions listed, 'gastroenteritis' typically presents with vomiting, abdominal pain, and indigestion. However, 'chronic cholestasis' can also present with abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and internal itching (pruritus), which is a key feature due to bile salt accumulation. The presence of internal itching strongly suggests a liver or biliary condition rather than a simple gastrointestinal infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: chronic cholestasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are a rash on the cheeks and nose spreading to the neck and chest, along with a fever. These symptoms are commonly seen in viral infections such as chicken pox, but chicken pox typically starts on the trunk and spreads to the face and extremities, and the rash is usually vesicular. Impetigo is a bacterial skin infection but is not typically associated with fever and widespread rash. Drug reaction and allergy can cause rashes, but the presence of fever suggests an infectious cause. Dengue and malaria can cause fever and rash, but the rash distribution described is more characteristic of chicken pox.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include a rash that began as small red sores near the nose and neck, which have become more painful and inflamed, along with a high temperature (fever). This presentation is characteristic of impetigo, a bacterial skin infection that often starts as red sores near the nose and mouth, which can spread and become inflamed and painful, sometimes accompanied by fever.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",

      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggests a form of hepatitis. The presence of joint pain and mild fever is more characteristic of hepatitis B, C, or E. However, hepatitis B and C are less likely to present acutely with these symptoms, while hepatitis E often presents with these symptoms, especially in adults.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis e\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include indigestion, headache, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, stiff neck, depression, irritability, and visual disturbances. Excessive hunger is a classic symptom of diabetes, and blurred vision can also be associated with high blood sugar levels. The combination of these symptoms points towards a metabolic disorder rather than an infectious or neurological one. While stiff neck can be seen in meningitis, the presence of excessive hunger and visual disturbances is more characteristic of diabetes.\n",

      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, family history, and mucoid sputum. These are classic symptoms of a respiratory infection, particularly one that is chronic and can be associated with a family history. Tuberculosis often presents with these symptoms, especially the combination of cough, mucoid sputum, and high fever.\n",
      "Condition: tuberculosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, high fever, sweating, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and muscle pain. These are classic symptoms of a systemic infection with fever and chills, and the combination of high fever, chills, sweating, and muscle pain is particularly characteristic of malaria.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include periodic coughing fits, terrible back pain, limb weakness, neck pain, and a dizzy and unstable sensation. While coughing could suggest a respiratory issue, the combination of back pain, neck pain, limb weakness, and dizziness points more towards a neurological or musculoskeletal condition. Cervical spondylosis is known to cause neck pain, back pain, limb weakness, and dizziness due to nerve compression in the cervical spine.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of itching, skin rash, and nodal skin eruptions are commonly associated with allergic reactions or drug reactions. However, nodal skin eruptions are more characteristic of a drug reaction, which often presents with various types of skin eruptions, including nodules, along with itching and rash.\n",
      "Condition: drug reaction\n",
      "Reasoning: A stiff neck can be associated with cervical spondylosis, and eye issues can also be related to this condition due to nerve involvement. Increased hunger is not a classic symptom of cervical spondylosis, but among the given options, cervical spondylosis best matches the combination of neck stiffness and possible neurological symptoms affecting the eyes.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, pus-filled pimples, blackheads, and scurring. These are classic signs of a skin condition characterized by clogged pores, inflammation, and sometimes infection, which is commonly seen in acne.\n",
      "Condition: acne\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, fatigue, yellowish skin, dark urine, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellow urine, yellowing of eyes, and malaise. Additionally, there is a history of receiving blood transfusions and unsterile injections. These are classic signs of hepatitis, particularly those transmitted via blood and bodily fluids. Among the hepatitis types, hepatitis c is commonly associated with transmission through blood transfusions and unsterile injections.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, shivering, chills, and watering from eyes. These are classic symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, commonly known as the common cold.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle weakness, stiff neck, swelling of joints, movement stiffness, and painful walking. These are characteristic of joint-related disorders, particularly those involving inflammation and degeneration. The combination of swelling joints, movement stiffness, and painful walking is most consistent with arthritis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, chills, joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, pain behind the eyes, back pain, malaise, and muscle pain. This combination, especially the presence of high fever, skin rash, pain behind the eyes, and muscle/joint pain, is characteristic of dengue.\n",
      "Condition: dengue\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), nausea, loss of appetite, and a family history. These are classic signs of hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B, C, or E, but family history is especially relevant for hepatitis B. The combination of jaundice, nausea, and loss of appetite is most consistent with hepatitis B from the list.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, yellowing of eyes, and a family history. The yellowish skin and eyes suggest jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of family history may point towards a hereditary or chronic liver disease. Among the options, hepatitis (various types) and jaundice are most relevant. However, jaundice is a symptom, not a disease. The combination of these symptoms most closely matches hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B, C, D, or E. Since family history is mentioned, hepatitis B is often associated with chronic infection and can be transmitted vertically (from mother to child), making it a likely candidate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, restlessness, lethargy, irregular sugar level, blurred and distorted vision, obesity, excessive hunger, increased appetite, and polyuria. These are classic symptoms of diabetes, which is characterized by high blood sugar levels, leading to increased hunger, frequent urination (polyuria), and blurred vision. Weight loss and fatigue are also common in uncontrolled diabetes.\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include back pain, weakness in limbs, neck pain, dizziness, and loss of balance. These are commonly associated with nerve compression or issues in the cervical spine, which can lead to neurological symptoms such as weakness and balance problems.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold hands and feet, mood swings, lethargy, dizziness, puffy face and eyes, enlarged thyroid, brittle nails, swollen extremities, depression, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an underactive thyroid gland, which is characteristic of hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hypothyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, red spots over the body, high fever, mild fever, headache, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, fatigue, and lethargy. This combination, especially the presence of red spots over the body, skin rash, and fever, is characteristic of chicken pox.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headaches, digestive issues (acid reflux and indigestion), sore neck, depression, irritability, and visual disturbance. The combination of headaches, visual disturbance, and neck pain could suggest migraine or cervical spondylosis, but the prominent digestive symptoms (acid reflux, indigestion) point more towards a gastrointestinal condition. Among the options, 'gerd' (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is characterized by acid reflux and indigestion, and can also be associated with headaches and mood changes due to chronic discomfort.\n",
      "Condition: gerd\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cramps, bruising, obesity, swollen legs, swollen blood vessels, and prominent veins on the calf. These are classic signs of venous insufficiency, particularly varicose veins, which are characterized by swollen, twisted veins visible under the skin, usually in the legs, and can cause swelling, cramps, and fatigue.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include headaches, nausea, sensitivity to light, and irritability. These are classic symptoms of migraine, which often presents with headache, nausea, and photophobia (sensitivity to light).\n",
      "Condition: migraine\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include itchy skin, rashes, discoloration, and lumps or bumps. These are common presentations of a skin condition, and among the options provided, \"fungal infection\" often presents with itchy, discolored patches and sometimes raised bumps. Other options like \"allergy\" could also cause rashes and itching, but the mention of discoloration and lumps is more characteristic of a fungal infection.\n",
      "Condition: fungal infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of headache, chest pain, dizziness, and lack of concentration can be seen in several conditions, but the combination of chest pain and dizziness is particularly concerning for a cardiovascular issue. Headache and lack of concentration can also be associated with reduced blood flow or oxygen to the brain, which can occur during a heart attack. Other conditions in the list do not typically present with this specific combination of symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of jaundice, which is often associated with liver conditions such as hepatitis. Among the options, hepatitis a, hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis d, hepatitis e, and jaundice are possible. However, the combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), along with gastrointestinal symptoms, most directly points to jaundice as the primary condition.\n",
      "Condition: jaundice\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms can be seen in several conditions, but the combination of chest pain, dizziness, and loss of balance is particularly concerning for a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack. Headache and lack of concentration can also occur due to reduced blood flow to the brain during such an event.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold hands and feet, mood swings, lethargy, dizziness, puffy face and eyes, enlarged thyroid, brittle nails, swollen extremities, depression, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an underactive thyroid gland, which is characteristic of hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hypothyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, blisters, red sores around the nose, and yellow crust oozing. These are classic signs of a bacterial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which is characterized by red sores that can rupture, ooze for a few days, and then form a yellowish-brown crust.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, blisters, red sores around the nose, and yellow crust oozing. These are classic signs of a superficial skin infection, particularly the presence of red sores and yellowish crusts, which are characteristic of impetigo.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include constipation, pain during bowel movements, pain in the anal region, bloody stool, and irritation in the anus. These are classic symptoms of hemorrhoids (piles), particularly when there is pain and bleeding associated with defecation and irritation in the anal area.\n",
      "Condition: dimorphic hemmorhoids(piles)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, fast heart rate, and rusty sputum. These are classic signs of a lower respiratory tract infection, particularly pneumonia, which often presents with productive cough (sometimes with rusty sputum), fever, chest pain, and breathlessness.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, mood swings, restlessness, sweating, diarrhea, fast heart rate, excessive hunger, muscle weakness, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These symptoms are commonly associated with an overactive thyroid, which is known as hyperthyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hyperthyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and gastrointestinal symptoms strongly suggests a form of hepatitis. The presence of joint pain and mild fever is more characteristic of hepatitis B, C, or E. However, hepatitis B and C are less likely to present acutely with diarrhoea and mild fever. Hepatitis E often presents with these symptoms, especially in the context of acute hepatitis with gastrointestinal involvement.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis e\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, high fever, headache, loss of appetite, mild fever, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, and red spots over the body. These are classic symptoms of chicken pox, which typically presents with a skin rash, fever, malaise, and red spots that can be itchy. Swollen lymph nodes and fatigue are also common in viral infections like chicken pox.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, joint pain, skin peeling, silver-like dusting, small dents in nails, and inflammatory nails. These are classic features of psoriasis, which often presents with silvery scales on the skin and nail changes such as pitting (small dents) and inflammation.\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include stomach pain, acidity, ulcers on the tongue, cough, and chest pain. The combination of stomach pain, acidity, and ulcers on the tongue points towards a gastrointestinal issue, particularly one involving acid. Chest pain and cough could be associated with acid reflux affecting the esophagus. The most fitting condition from the list that matches these symptoms is peptic ulcer disease.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, headache, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, toxic look (typhos), and belly pain. The presence of high fever, abdominal pain, constipation, and a toxic look (typhos) are classic features of typhoid fever.\n",
      "Condition: typhoid\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, high fever, yellowish skin, dark urine, and abdominal pain. The combination of yellowish skin and dark urine suggests jaundice, which is commonly associated with liver conditions. The presence of high fever and abdominal pain further supports a liver infection. Among the hepatitis types, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis a, hepatitis d, or hepatitis e. However, the combination of weight loss and chronic symptoms is most characteristic of hepatitis c.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, joint pain, skin peeling, silver-like dusting, small dents in nails, and inflammatory nails. These are classic features of psoriasis, which often presents with silvery scales on the skin and nail changes such as pitting (small dents) and inflammation.\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, neck pain, hip joint pain, swelling of joints, and painful walking. These are characteristic of a condition affecting multiple joints, often with swelling and pain, which is typical of arthritis.\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",

      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, fast heart rate, and rusty sputum. These are classic signs of a lower respiratory tract infection, particularly pneumonia, where rusty sputum is a hallmark feature.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are acid reflux, nausea, and stomach pain. These are classic symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is characterized by acid reflux and associated gastrointestinal discomfort.\n",
      "Condition: gerd\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, headache, nausea, spinning movements, loss of balance, and unsteadiness. These are classic signs of vertigo, particularly positional vertigo, which is characterized by spinning sensations and balance issues.\n",
      "Condition: (vertigo) paroymsal  positional vertigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include fever, chills, vomiting, sweating, headache, nausea, and muscle aches. These are classic symptoms of malaria, which typically presents with cyclical fevers, chills, sweating, and muscle aches. Other conditions on the list may share some symptoms, but the combination of fever, chills, and sweating is most characteristic of malaria.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, headache, nausea, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, toxic look (typhos), and belly pain. The combination of high fever, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhoea, and a toxic appearance is characteristic of typhoid fever (typhos refers to typhoid). These symptoms are not typical for malaria (which usually has periodic fever and chills), dengue (which often has severe muscle pain and rash), or gastroenteritis (which usually lacks the toxic look and high fever). The presence of \"toxic look (typhos)\" specifically points towards typhoid.\n",
      "Condition: typhoid\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing, tachycardia (heart racing), sweating, chills (feeling cold), fatigue, and coughing up brown phlegm. These are classic signs of a lower respiratory tract infection, particularly pneumonia, which often presents with productive cough (sometimes with colored sputum), fever, and respiratory distress.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: A sour taste in the mouth and difficulty swallowing are classic symptoms of acid reflux, which is associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is characterized by the backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus, leading to these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: gerd\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include a red, inflamed rash that is spreading all over the body and is accompanied by intense itching, especially on the arms and legs. These symptoms are characteristic of an allergic reaction, which often presents with widespread rash and itching. Other conditions on the list such as fungal infection or impetigo could cause rashes, but the rapid spread and intense itching are more typical of an allergy.\n",
      "Condition: allergy\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, fatigue, lethargy, high fever, headache, loss of appetite, mild fever, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, and red spots over the body. The combination of high fever, malaise, and red spots over the body is characteristic of viral infections like chicken pox or dengue. However, the presence of itching and red spots over the body, along with mild fever and swelled lymph nodes, is more typical of chicken pox.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, sweating, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and muscle pain. These are classic symptoms of a febrile illness with systemic involvement. The combination of chills, sweating, and muscle pain is particularly suggestive of malaria, which often presents with these symptoms due to the cyclical rupture of red blood cells. Other conditions in the list do not typically present with this exact constellation of symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, weight loss, restlessness, lethargy, irregular sugar level, blurred and distorted vision, obesity, excessive hunger, increased appetite, and polyuria. These are classic symptoms of diabetes, particularly the irregular sugar level, polyuria (frequent urination), excessive hunger, and blurred vision.\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, vomiting, yellowish skin, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and yellowing of eyes. These are classic signs of jaundice, which is often associated with liver conditions. The yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice) point towards a hepatic issue. Among the options, hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E) and jaundice are possible, but the combination of these symptoms most directly matches \"jaundice\" as a condition.\n",
      "Condition: jaundice\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, shivering, chills, and watering from eyes. These are classic symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, commonly known as the common cold.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include back pain, neck pain, weakness in limbs, balance and dizziness issues, and difficulty breathing. These symptoms are characteristic of nerve compression or spinal cord involvement, particularly in the cervical region, which can cause neurological deficits and balance problems.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of sour taste in the mouth, frequent burping and belching, and a feeling of pressure or fullness in the upper abdomen are classic signs of acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux. These symptoms are most consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n",

Among the options, these symptoms best fit with 'allergy', as allergies often present with itching, rashes, and skin eruptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: allergy\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include acidity, indigestion, headache, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, stiff neck, depression, irritability, and visual disturbances. The combination of excessive hunger, visual disturbances, and irritability points towards a metabolic disorder affecting blood sugar levels. These are classic symptoms of hypoglycemia, which can cause neurological symptoms (headache, blurred vision, irritability, depression) and autonomic symptoms (hunger, indigestion).\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, nodal skin eruptions, and dischromic patches. These are characteristic of a skin-related condition, particularly one involving a hypersensitivity or immune response. Among the options, 'fungal infection' and 'allergy' are possible, but the presence of nodal skin eruptions and dischromic patches is more typical of an allergic reaction rather than a fungal infection, which usually presents with scaling, redness, and sometimes ring-shaped lesions. Therefore, 'allergy' is the most fitting condition from the list.\n",
      "Condition: allergy\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, fast heart rate, and rusty sputum.

      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, and muscle pain. The combination of yellowish skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, and abdominal pain suggests a liver-related condition. The presence of mild fever and muscle pain can also be seen in viral hepatitis. Among the hepatitis types listed, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis b, hepatitis c, hepatitis a, hepatitis d, or hepatitis e. However, the presence of joint pain is particularly associated with hepatitis b.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are persistent sores on the face, particularly on the cheeks, that are big, painful, slow to heal, and prone to infection. This presentation is most consistent with acne, which often causes large, painful lesions (cystic acne) that can be difficult to treat and may become infected.\n",
      "Condition: acne\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, sunken eyes, dehydration, and diarrhoea are classic signs of a gastrointestinal infection leading to fluid loss and dehydration. These are most commonly seen in gastroenteritis.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms can be associated with several conditions, but the combination of chest pain, dizziness, and loss of balance is particularly concerning for a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack. Headache and lack of concentration can also occur during a heart attack due to reduced blood flow to the brain.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include dizziness, nausea, shakiness, swollen throat with trouble breathing, chest pain, and feeling sick. The combination of swollen throat, trouble breathing, and systemic symptoms like dizziness and shakiness strongly suggests an acute allergic reaction, possibly anaphylaxis.

Chest pain and cough could be related to acid reflux affecting the esophagus. The most fitting condition from the list that matches these symptoms is peptic ulcer disease.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are a rash that is itchy and uncomfortable, along with small dents in the nails. Nail pitting (small dents in the nails) is a classic sign of psoriasis, and psoriasis often presents with itchy, uncomfortable skin rashes.\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, breathlessness, sweating, and chest pain are classic signs of a cardiac event, particularly a heart attack. These symptoms together are not typical of respiratory, gastrointestinal, or infectious diseases, but are highly suggestive of an acute myocardial infarction.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include back pain, weakness in limbs, sore neck, dizziness, and being off balance. These symptoms are suggestive of a neurological or musculoskeletal issue, particularly involving the cervical spine, which can cause limb weakness, neck pain, and balance problems due to nerve compression. The productive cough is less typical but could be coincidental or due to another minor issue. The combination of neck pain, limb weakness, and dizziness points most strongly to cervical spondylosis.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include back pain, weakness in limbs, neck pain, dizziness, and loss of balance. These are commonly associated with nerve compression or issues in the cervical spine, which can lead to neurological symptoms such as weakness and balance problems.\n",

      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, cold hands and feet, mood swings, lethargy, dizziness, puffy face and eyes, enlarged thyroid, brittle nails, swollen extremities, depression, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of an underactive thyroid gland, which is known as hypothyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hypothyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The presence of red, itchy spots on the arms and back suggests a skin-related condition, possibly an infection or allergic reaction. The additional symptom of feeling tired could be due to the body's response to the skin issue. Among the options, \"fungal infection\" and \"allergy\" are possibilities, but fungal infections are less likely to cause widespread red spots and more likely to cause localized patches. \"Allergy\" commonly presents with itchy, red spots (hives or rash) and can be associated with fatigue due to the body's immune response.\n",
      "Condition: allergy\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, loss of appetite, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, and blood in sputum. These symptoms are characteristic of tuberculosis, which often presents with chronic cough, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and sometimes hemoptysis (blood in sputum). The presence of swelled lymph nodes and malaise further supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "Condition: tuberculosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle wasting, patches in the throat, high fever, and a history of extra-marital contacts.

Among the hepatitis types listed, hepatitis B, C, D, A, and E are present. The acute and severe presentation with liver failure and bleeding is most commonly associated with hepatitis B.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include fatigue, cramps, bruising, obesity, swollen legs, swollen blood vessels, and prominent veins on the calf. These are classic signs of venous insufficiency, particularly varicose veins, which are characterized by swollen, twisted veins visible under the skin, most commonly in the legs, and can cause swelling, cramps, and fatigue.\n",
      "Condition: varicose veins\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include jaundice (yellowish skin, yellowing of eyes, yellow urine), fatigue, malaise, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and risk factors such as receiving blood transfusions and unsterile injections. These are classic signs of a viral hepatitis infection, particularly hepatitis C, which is commonly transmitted through blood and can present with these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, headache, malaise, phlegm, throat irritation, redness of eyes, sinus pressure, runny nose, congestion, chest pain, loss of smell, and muscle pain. These are classic symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, commonly known as the common cold. The presence of loss of smell, runny nose, congestion, and sneezing further supports this diagnosis.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, toxic look (typhos), and belly pain. The presence of high fever, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and a toxic look (typhos) are classic features of typhoid fever.\n",
      "Condition: typhoid\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, stomach pain, burning micturition, and spotting during urination. These are commonly associated with infections of the urinary tract, which often present with burning sensation during urination and sometimes abdominal pain. Spotting and itching can also be related to urinary tract issues.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, high fever, sweating, headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and muscle pain. These are classic symptoms of a systemic infection with fever and gastrointestinal involvement. Malaria commonly presents with chills, high fever, sweating, headache, nausea, vomiting, and muscle pain. The combination of chills and high fever with sweating is particularly characteristic of malaria.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: Blurry vision, fatigue, dizziness, and lightheadedness are common symptoms of high blood sugar levels, which are often seen in diabetes. These symptoms are not specific to conditions like hypertension, anemia, or neurological disorders in the given list, but they fit well with diabetes.\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, weakness of one body side (hemiparesis), and altered sensorium. This combination is highly suggestive of a neurological event, most likely a stroke or brain hemorrhage, which can cause sudden weakness on one side and changes in consciousness.\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include a rash that is itchy and red, with patches of different color and some pimples that look like little balls. These features are characteristic of a fungal infection, which often presents with itchy, red, and patchy rashes, sometimes with pustules or pimple-like lesions.\n",
      "Condition: fungal infection\n",
      "Reasoning: Muscle wasting, high fever, and a history of extra marital contacts are suggestive of a chronic infectious disease that can be sexually transmitted and cause systemic symptoms including weight loss (muscle wasting) and fever. These are classic features of HIV/AIDS.\n",
      "Condition: aids\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include burning micturition (painful urination), bladder discomfort, foul smell of urine, and a continuous feeling of needing to urinate. These are classic signs of a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, fatigue, weight loss, cough, high fever, breathlessness, sweating, loss of appetite, mild fever, yellowing of eyes, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, phlegm, chest pain, and blood in sputum. These symptoms are characteristic of tuberculosis, which often presents with chronic cough, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and sometimes hemoptysis (blood in sputum). Swollen lymph nodes and malaise further support this diagnosis.\n",
      "Condition: tuberculosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain in multiple areas (neck, knee, hip), as well as swelling of the joints. These are classic signs of arthritis, which is characterized by pain and swelling in the joints.\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, shivering, chills, and watering from eyes. These are classic symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, commonly known as the common cold.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, red spots over the body, high fever, mild fever, headache, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, fatigue, and lethargy. This combination, especially the presence of red spots, skin rash, and fever, is characteristic of chicken pox.\n",
      "Condition: chicken pox\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include chills, vomiting, fatigue, high fever, headache, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, toxic look (typhos), and belly pain. The presence of high fever, abdominal symptoms, and a toxic look (typhos) are classic for typhoid fever.\n",
      "Condition: typhoid\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, feeling unstable/off balance, feeling unwell, and problems focusing. The combination of chest pain and neurological symptoms (instability, problems focusing) could suggest a serious cardiovascular or neurological event. Among the options, \"paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\" and \"heart attack\" are possibilities, but the presence of feeling off balance and problems focusing points more towards a neurological cause, such as a brain hemorrhage leading to paralysis or vertigo. However, \"paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\" is more likely to present with sudden neurological deficits, while \"(vertigo) paroymsal positional vertigo\" would primarily cause dizziness and imbalance without chest pain. Given the chest pain and headache, \"heart attack\" is the most likely among the options, as it can present with chest pain, headache, feeling unwell, and sometimes neurological symptoms due to poor perfusion.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include jaundice (yellowish skin, yellowing of eyes, yellow urine), fatigue, lethargy, malaise, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and risk factors such as receiving blood transfusions and unsterile injections. These are classic features of viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis C, which is commonly transmitted through blood and can present with these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis c\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include acidity, indigestion, headache, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, stiff neck, depression, and irritability. Excessive hunger is a classic symptom of diabetes, and when combined with other symptoms like headache, blurred vision, and irritability, it points towards blood sugar dysregulation. Acidity and indigestion can also be associated with diabetes due to gastroparesis. Stiff neck is less typical but can occur due to dehydration or metabolic disturbances. The combination of these symptoms most closely matches diabetes from the list.\n",
      "Condition: diabetes\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, stomach pain, burning micturition, and spotting on urination. Burning micturition and spotting on urination are classic signs of a urinary tract infection. Skin rash and itching can sometimes occur due to systemic infection or as a reaction, but the combination with urinary symptoms points most strongly to a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include mood swings, weight loss, restlessness, sweating, diarrhea, fast heart rate, excessive hunger, muscle weakness, irritability, and abnormal menstruation. These are classic signs of increased metabolic activity, which is characteristic of hyperthyroidism.\n",
      "Condition: hyperthyroidism\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, skin peeling, silver-like dusting, small dents in nails, and inflammatory nails. These are classic features of psoriasis, which often presents with silvery scales on the skin and nail changes such as pitting (small dents) and inflammation.\n",
      "Condition: psoriasis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, blisters, red sores around the nose, and yellow crust oozing. These are classic signs of a superficial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which is characterized by red sores that can rupture, ooze, and form a yellow-brown crust, often around the nose and mouth.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle pain, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, back pain, malaise, chills, and red spots over the body. This combination, especially the pain behind the eyes, high fever, rash, and muscle/joint pain, is characteristic of dengue.\n",
      "Condition: dengue\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin peeling and rashes, increased susceptibility to illness, and hand tremors/shakiness. Skin rashes and peeling can be associated with allergies, drug reactions, or infections. Increased frequency of illness suggests a possible immune compromise, which can be seen in conditions like AIDS. Hand tremors and shakiness can be due to hypoglycemia, hyperthyroidism, or neurological issues. However, the combination of skin issues, increased infections, and neurological symptoms (shakiness) most closely aligns with AIDS, as it is known to cause immune suppression leading to frequent infections and various skin manifestations.\n",
      "Condition: aids\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include muscle wasting, patches in the throat, high fever, and a history of extra-marital contacts. These are classic signs of a chronic immunodeficiency, particularly AIDS, which is associated with opportunistic infections (patches in throat), muscle wasting, and is often linked to high-risk sexual behavior.\n",
      "Condition: aids\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, sunken eyes, dehydration, and diarrhoea are commonly seen in cases of acute gastrointestinal infections, which lead to fluid loss and dehydration. These are classic features of gastroenteritis.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, headache, weakness of one body side, and altered sensorium. These are classic signs of a neurological event, particularly a stroke or brain hemorrhage, where there is sudden weakness on one side of the body and changes in consciousness.\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include acidity, indigestion, headache, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, stiff neck, depression, irritability, and visual disturbances. The combination of excessive hunger, visual disturbances, headache, and irritability points towards a metabolic disorder affecting blood sugar levels. These are classic symptoms of hypoglycemia, which can cause neurological symptoms (headache, blurred vision, irritability, depression) and autonomic symptoms (hunger, indigestion).\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: hypoglycemia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, headache, and altered sensorium are commonly seen in malaria, especially in severe cases where cerebral involvement (cerebral malaria) can occur. These symptoms are less typical for other conditions in the list.\n",
      "Condition: malaria\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, indigestion, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and passage of gases. These are classic gastrointestinal symptoms, commonly seen in conditions affecting the stomach and intestines. Among the given options, \"peptic ulcer disease\" is characterized by abdominal pain, indigestion, and sometimes vomiting. \"Gastroenteritis\" also presents with vomiting and abdominal pain, but usually includes diarrhea, which is not mentioned here. \"Peptic ulcer disease\" fits best with the provided symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: peptic ulcer disease\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, headache, pain behind the eyes, joint pain, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, chills, malaise, back pain, and red spots over the body. This combination, especially the pain behind the eyes, high fever, rash, and red spots, is characteristic of dengue.\n",
      "Condition: dengue\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, nodal skin eruptions, and dischromic patches. These are commonly associated with allergic reactions or skin infections. However, the presence of nodal skin eruptions and dischromic patches is more characteristic of a fungal infection rather than a simple allergy or drug reaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition: fungal infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, chills, cough, high fever, headache, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, phlegm, throat irritation, redness of eyes, sinus pressure, runny nose, congestion, chest pain, loss of smell, and muscle pain. These are classic symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, commonly known as the common cold. The presence of runny nose, sneezing, congestion, and loss of smell are particularly indicative of this condition.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include cough, trouble breathing, chills, fever, weakness, tiredness, and production of phlegm. These are classic signs of a lower respiratory tract infection, most notably pneumonia. The presence of productive cough (phlegm), fever, and chills further supports this diagnosis over other respiratory conditions like bronchial asthma, which typically does not present with fever or chills.\n",
      "Condition: pneumonia\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include neck stiffness, joint swelling, muscular weakness, and discomfort while walking. These symptoms are commonly associated with cervical spondylosis, which affects the neck and can cause stiffness, weakness, and discomfort in movement.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, chills, fatigue, cough, high fever, headache, swelled lymph nodes, phlegm, throat irritation, redness of eyes, sinus pressure, runny nose, congestion, chest pain, loss of smell, and muscle pain. These are classic symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, commonly known as the common cold. The presence of runny nose, sneezing, congestion, and loss of smell are particularly indicative of this condition.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include vomiting, fatigue (no energy), weight loss, jaundice (yellow skin), dark urine, and abdominal pain. These are classic signs of liver dysfunction, particularly jaundice and dark urine, which suggest a buildup of bilirubin. The combination of these symptoms is most consistent with hepatitis, which is inflammation of the liver. The list includes several types of hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E, and alcoholic hepatitis). There is no mention of alcohol use, so alcoholic hepatitis is less likely. The symptoms fit with any of the viral hepatitis types, but without more specific information, the most general and likely is hepatitis a, as it often presents acutely with these symptoms.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis a\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described are a rash on the face that is red, inflamed, has blisters, is bleeding clear pus, and is very painful. These are classic signs of a skin infection, particularly one that involves blisters and pus. Among the conditions listed, \"impetigo\" is a bacterial skin infection that commonly presents with red sores or blisters that can ooze and form a yellowish crust, often seen on the face. The presence of blisters and pus fits impetigo best.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, shivering, chills, and watering from eyes. These are classic symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, commonly known as the common cold.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include skin rash, high fever, blisters, red sores around the nose, and yellow crust oozing. These are classic signs of a bacterial skin infection, particularly impetigo, which is characterized by red sores that can rupture, ooze for a few days, and then form a yellowish-brown crust.\n",
      "Condition: impetigo\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include sore throat, frequent sneezing, and facial swelling (especially lips and around the eyes). These are classic signs of an allergic reaction, particularly the swelling (angioedema) and sneezing fits, which are not typical of infections like the common cold.\n",
      "Condition: allergy\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include trouble swallowing, early satiety (feeling full quickly), heartburn, nausea, and tingling in the throat. These are classic symptoms of acid reflux affecting the esophagus, which is characteristic of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n",
      "Condition: gerd\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of vomiting, sunken eyes, and diarrhoea are classic signs of dehydration, often due to an acute gastrointestinal infection. These symptoms are most commonly seen in gastroenteritis, which is characterized by inflammation of the stomach and intestines, leading to vomiting and diarrhoea. Sunken eyes are a sign of dehydration, which can result from significant fluid loss due to diarrhoea and vomiting.\n",
      "Condition: gastroenteritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include continuous sneezing, runny nose, congestion, throat irritation, sinus pressure, and loss of smell, which are classic for upper respiratory tract infections. Additional symptoms like chills, fatigue, high fever, headache, malaise, phlegm, redness of eyes, swelled lymph nodes, chest pain, and muscle pain suggest a viral infection affecting the respiratory system. These symptoms are most consistent with a common viral cold.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include acidity, indigestion, headache, blurred and distorted vision, excessive hunger, stiff neck, depression, irritability, and visual disturbances. The combination of headache, visual disturbances, and irritability is characteristic of migraine. Other conditions in the list do not typically present with this specific cluster of symptoms, especially the visual disturbances and headache together.\n",
      "Condition: migraine\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include burning micturition (painful urination), bladder discomfort, foul smell of urine, and a continuous feeling of needing to urinate. These are classic symptoms of a urinary tract infection.\n",
      "Condition: urinary tract infection\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include stiff neck, muscle weakness, swelling in joints, and pain while walking. These are characteristic of joint inflammation and musculoskeletal issues, which are commonly seen in arthritis-related conditions. The presence of joint swelling and pain with difficulty in movement points towards arthritis rather than other conditions like infections, metabolic, or neurological disorders.\n",
      "Condition: arthritis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include headache, chest pain, dizziness, loss of balance, and lack of concentration. These symptoms can be associated with several conditions, but the combination of chest pain, dizziness, and loss of balance is particularly concerning for a cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack. Headache and lack of concentration can also occur during a heart attack due to reduced blood flow to the brain.\n",
      "Condition: heart attack\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms described include sneezing, fatigue, sore throat, excessive mucus, and swollen/puffy neck. These are classic symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection, most commonly the common cold. The swollen neck could be due to lymph node enlargement, which is also common in viral infections like the common cold.\n",
      "Condition: common cold\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include vomiting, headache, and weakness of one body side. Weakness of one side of the body is a classic sign of a neurological event, such as a stroke or brain hemorrhage. Vomiting and headache can also be associated with increased intracranial pressure or brain injury.\n",
      "Condition: paralysis (brain hemorrhage)\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include joint pain, vomiting, fatigue, yellowish skin, dark urine, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of eyes, acute liver failure, coma, and stomach bleeding. These are classic signs of severe hepatitis, particularly with jaundice (yellowish skin and eyes), liver failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Among the hepatitis types listed, these symptoms are most consistent with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis A, hepatitis D, or hepatitis E. However, acute liver failure and severe symptoms like coma and stomach bleeding are most commonly associated with hepatitis B.\n",
      "Condition: hepatitis b\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms of back pain, weakness in limbs, dizziness, and loss of balance are commonly associated with nerve compression or issues related to the cervical spine. These are classic features of cervical spondylosis, which can cause neurological deficits due to spinal cord or nerve root compression.\n",
      "Condition: cervical spondylosis\n",
      "Reasoning: The symptoms include itching, skin rash, high fever, headache, loss of appetite, mild fever, swelled lymph nodes, malaise, and red spots over the body.
